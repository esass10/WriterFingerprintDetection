18634,/bob-dylan/,Blowin' In The Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes n'how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?

The answer my friend is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

Yes n'how many years can a mountain exist
Before its washed to the sea?
Yes n'how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes n'how many times can a man turn his head
Pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer my friend is blowing in the wind
the answer is blowing in the wind

Yes n'how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes n'how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
Yes n'how many deaths will it take till he know
That too many people have died

The answer my friend is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind"
18635,/bob-dylan/,Like A Rolling Stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime,
didn't you?
People call say:
'beware doll, you're bound to fall'
You thought they were all
kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel,
how does it feel?
To be without a home,
Like a complete unknown,
like a rolling stone

Ahh you've gone to the finest schools,
alright Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to
get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to
live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp,
but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say 'do you want to make a deal?'

How does it feel,
how does it feel?
To be on your own,
with no direction home
A complete unknown,
like a rolling stone

Ah you never turned around to see
the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
when they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people
get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse
with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discovered that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you
everything he could steal

How does it feel,
how does it feel?
To have on your own,
with no direction home
Like a complete unknown,
like a rolling stone

Ahh princess on a steeple
and all the pretty people
They're all drinking,
thinking that they've got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you better take your diamond ring,
you better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags
and the language that he used
Go to him, he calls you,
you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing,
you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now,
you've got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel,
ah how does it feel?
To be on your own,
with no direction home
Like a complete unknown,
like a rolling stone"
18636,/bob-dylan/,Knockin' On Heaven's Door,"Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, put that gun to the ground
Cause i can't shoot them anymore
ThereÂ´s a long black cloud coming on down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh"
18637,/bob-dylan/,Hurricane,"Pistol shots ring out in the ballroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood,
Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""
Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously.
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops.""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night.

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that.
In Paterson that's just the way things go.
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat.

Alfred Bello had a partner
and he had a rap for the cops.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out,
they looked likemiddleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head.
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men.

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in,
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!""
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame,
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him,
lookin' for somebody to blame.
""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter
that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white.""

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure.""
Cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail,
be a nice fellow.
You'll be doin' society a favor.
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim.""

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail.
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.
The judge made Rubin's witnesses
drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
And though they could not produce the gun,
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed.

Rubin Carter was falsely tried.
The crime was murder ""one,"" guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game.

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell.
That's the story of the Hurricane,
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world."
18638,/bob-dylan/,Mr. Tambourine Man,"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Though you might hear laughin', spinnin',
swingin' madly across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seein' that he's chasing.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you."
18639,/bob-dylan/,"Lay, Lady, Lay","Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead"
18640,/bob-dylan/,Masters Of War,"Come you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just don't want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead"
18641,/bob-dylan/,Forever Young,"May God bless and keep you always,
May your wishes all come true,
May you always do for others
And let others do for you.
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.

May you grow up to be righteous,
May you grow up to be true,
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you.
May you always be courageous,
Stand upright and be strong,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.

May your hands always be busy,
May your feet always be swift,
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift.
May your heart always be joyful,
May your song always be sung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.

18642,/bob-dylan/,The Times They Are A-Changin',"Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
That it's namin'.
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
And it is ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin(g)'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'."
18643,/bob-dylan/,All Along The Watchtower,"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,
""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.""

""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,
""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.""

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
"
18644,/bob-dylan/,Too Late,"Well, whether there was a murder, I don't know, I wasn't there
I was busy visiting a friend in jail
There were just two women on the scene at the time
Neither one of 'em saw a thing, both of 'em were wearing veils
They said it was a natural situation
He reached too high and tumbled back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to people on your way up
""You might meet 'em again on your way back down""

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

He had a brother named Paul hang out at the cafe royal
Where Miss Dolly plays and the reviews have been mixed
Well, he's pretty to look at looking for someone to throw the book at
But you know that he drinks and drinks, can't be fixed
Sing me one more song about your summer romance, I know
You don't know ""Motherless Children""
sing me the one about you and Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion where conformity's a fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

Dr. Silver Spoon from the empress ballroom
He's a retired businessman who feeds off everyone he's touched
Gives money to the church and foundations for research
He's not someone you can play around with too much
But then there's Rosetta Blake who's been to both sides of the lake
She's rough to look at but she's righteously fit
She'll feed you coconut bread and spiced buns in bed
You won't have to worry 'bout sleeping face down
with your head in the plate

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

You'll arrange to see your man tonight
Who tells you some secret things you think might open some doors
How to enter the gates of paradise, no not really
More like how to go crazy from carrying a burden
that's never meant to be yours
From the stage they'll be doing the bumps and the grinds
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin
and build big universities to study in
And sing Amazing Grace all the way to the Swiss Bank

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

They got some serious people out there, man
They can ring your bell and show you how to hold your tongue
They don't come to party, man
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don't believe in mercy
And judgment on them is something you'll never see
They can put your face on a postage stamp
Turn your home into an armed camp anyway they want you
That's the way you'll be

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

Yes, I loved him too
I still see him in my mind climbing up that hill
Or was it a wall, I don't recall
It don't matter at all and it never will
Ain't nothing left here partner
Just the dust of fools that have left their mark in spades
From now on this will be where you're from
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come
Feel that hot iron glowing now as you raise the shades

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back"
18645,/bob-dylan/,License to Kill,"Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don't change soon, he will.
Oh, man has invented his doom,
First step was touching the moon.

Now, there's a woman on my block,
She just sit there as the night grows still.
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill,
Then they bury him with stars,
Sell his body like they do used cars.

Now, there's a woman on my block,
She just sit there facin' the hill.
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused,
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies.

But there's a woman on my block,
Sitting there in a cold chill.
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

Ya may be a noisemaker, spirit maker,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Leave no stone unturned.
May be an actor in a plot,
That might be all that you got
'Til your error you clearly learn.

Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Oh, man is opposed to fair play,
He wants it all and he wants it his way.

She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

Crying like a fire in the sun.

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
All your reindeer armies, are all going home.
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.

Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue."

Mysterious and dark.

Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost,
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world

I ain't too good at conversation, girl,

That's hanging in the Louvre,
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches

Yesterday's gone but the past lives on,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, oh, yeah.

Who are these people who are walking towards you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through,
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?

Do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line.

Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
No more booby traps and bombs,
No more decadence and charm,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn't dance.

Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
And I need you, yeah.

18651,/bob-dylan/,Jokerman,"Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Distant ships sailing into the mist,
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one.
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister.
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister.
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed,
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
Oh. oh. oh. Jokerman.

Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain.
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

18652,/bob-dylan/,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.

Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts.
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, Henry Kissinger's got you tied up in knots.

When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up

You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never cure your ills.

When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You got men who can't hold their peace and women who can't control their tongues,
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.

When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.

When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved.

When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires.

When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You can't take it with you and you know that it's too worthless to be sold,
They tell you, ""Time is money"" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.

When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

There's a Man up on a cross and He's been crucified.
Do you have any idea why or for who He died?

When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

18655,/bob-dylan/,A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,

I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles
in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard,
it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby
with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
I saw a room full of men
with their hammers a-bleedin',
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I saw ten thousand talkers
whose tongues were all broken,
I saw guns and sharp swords
in the hands of young children,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder,
it roared out a warnin',
Heard the roar of a wave
that could drown the whole world,
Heard one hundred drummers
whose hands were a-blazin',
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
Heard one person starve,
I heard many people laughin',
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard,
it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I met a white man
who walked a black dog,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I met another man who was wounded with hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard,
it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
Where the people are many
and their hands are all empty,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where the home in the valley
meets the damp dirty prison,
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,
And reflect it from the mountain
so all souls can see it,
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
But I'll know my song well before I start singin',
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall."
18656,/bob-dylan/,I Pity the Poor Immigrant,"I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he would've stayed home,
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone.
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with ev'ry breath,
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death.

I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain,
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,
Whose tears are like rain,
Who eats but is not satisfied,
Who hears but does not see,
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me.

I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud,
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood,
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass.
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass.

She's speaking to me, speaking with her eyes

I've already outlived my life by far

Mother of Muses, unleash your wrath
Things I can't see, they're blocking my path
Show me your wisdom, tell me my fate
Put me upright, make me walk straight
Forge my identity from the inside out
You know what I'm talking about

Take me to the river, release your charms
Let me down a while in your sweet, loving arms
Wake me, shake me, free me from sin
Make me invisible, like the wind

And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul.

I stood there and hummed,

And straightened her suit,

And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her

Forgotten my shirt,

And when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, ""No, dear.""
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,

She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor,
And I covered her up and then
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.

Or a friend when you're lonesome or a love that's grown cold;
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.

Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Carryin' a dead man's shield
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel

The sufferin' is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Walkin' ever since the other night.
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.

As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Up the road, around the bend.
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
In the last outback at the world's end."

Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weepin' in unholy places

18681,/bob-dylan/,Arthur McBride,"1. Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,
Mark now what followed and what did betide,
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp,
For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.

2. ""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried.
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,
Intending no harm but meant to pass by,
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,
And drink the king's health in the morning.

3. ""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,
And he always lives pleasant and charmin',
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""

Instrumental

4. ""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,
But you dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,
And although that we're single and free,
We take great delight in our own company,
We have no desire strange places to see,
Although that your offers are charming.

5. ""And we have no desire to take your advance,
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,
Where we would get shot without warning,""
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat,
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,
For if you insult me with one other word,
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""

6. And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning.
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,
""And temper their edge in the mornin'!""

7. And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,
And bade it a tedious returning,
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,
And left them for dead in the morning.

8. And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.

9. Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,
Mark now what followed and what did betide,

18682,/bob-dylan/,As I Went Out One Morning,"As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains.
I offer'd her my hand,
She took me by the arm.
I knew that very instant,
She meant to do me harm.

""Depart from me this moment,""
I told her with my voice.
Said she, ""But I don't wish to,""
Said I, ""But you have no choice.""
""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth,
""I will secretly accept you
And together we'll fly south.""

Just then Tom Paine, himself,
Came running from across the field,
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield.
And as she was letting go her grip,
Up Tom Paine did run,
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,
""I'm sorry for what she's done.""

18689,/bob-dylan/,Ballad in Plain D,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,
Gone as the season she's taken.

Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.

Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her.

For her parasite sister, I had no respect,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.

Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,
The changes I was going through can't even be used,
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.

With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To a sin of love's false security.

From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""

And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces.

""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.

Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.

All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.

The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.

Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""
And I answer them most mysteriously,
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""
"
18690,/bob-dylan/,Ballad of a Thin Man,"You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, ""Who is that man?""

Because something is happening here

Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations

You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""NOW""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back, ""You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home""

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is

Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
T.ike the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass it is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born

18692,/bob-dylan/,Be Careful Of Stones That You Throw,"A tongue can accuse or carry bad news
The seeds of destruction it will sow
So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw
My neighbor was passin' my garden one time
She smiled and I knew right away
That it was gossip not flowers that she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say

""That bad girl down the street
She should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She knows not to speak to my child nor to me. ""
My neighbor then smiled and I thought
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of destruction it will sow
So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw

A car speeded by, the screamin' of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For if my neighbor's one child
Hadn't been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl I love still
Her child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
""Oh, who was that brave girl so sweet? ""
I covered the crushed broken body and said
""That bad girl down the street. ""

A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of destruction were sown
So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you, you throw"
18693,/bob-dylan/,Belle Isle,"One evening for pleasure I rambled to view
The fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron
Where beauty and pleasure were known.

I spied a fair maid at her labour
Which caused me to stay for a while
And I thought of a goddess to beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.

I humbled myself to her beauty
""Fair maiden, where do you belong ?
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"".

""Young man, I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure.

Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"".

""Young maiden I wish not to banter
It's true I come here in disguise
I came here to fulfill our last promise
And hope to give you a surprise.

I've known you're a maid I love dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"".

Who ruled babylon and all it's land
Around the city
Well, the bible tells us about a man
Who ruled babylon and all it's land
Around the city, he built a wall
Declared that babylon would never fall

He had and wives
He called his babylon paradise
On his throne he drank and ate
But for belshezaar it was gettin' late
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, it could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
Praised the false gods of their time
Holy things they scorned and mocked
Suddenly all their mocking stopped
For on the wall, there appeared a hand
Nothin' else, there was no man
In blood the hand began to write
And belshezaar couldn't hide his fright

He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, it could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand
Well, no one around could understand
Just what was written by this mystic hand
Belshezaar tried, he couldn't find
A man who could give him some peace of mind

Daniel, the prophet, a man of God
He saw the writing on the wall in blood
Belshezaar asked him what it said
And daniel turned to the wall and read
You are weighed in the balance and found wanting
Your kingdom is divided, it cannot stand
You are weighed in the balance and found wanting
Your houses are built upon the sand"

Bessie was more than just a friend of mine

I still recall the best thing I ever had

I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, See her soon
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
When I get there I wonder what she'll do

Well I tried them all and then some
But if you're lucky one day you find out
Where it is you're really comin' from

I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, See her soon
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
When I get there I wonder what she'll do

Now in my day I've made some foolish moves
But back then, I didn't worry 'bout a thing
And now again I still wonder to myself
Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing

I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, See her soon
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
When I get there I wonder what she'll do

There's so much time has gone right on by
I didn't think one could be so wrong
And then one night I was drinkin' and a-thinkin'
In the bottom of the glass I could see Bessie's face so strong

I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, See her soon
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
When I get there I wonder what she'll do

When she sees me will she know what I've been through?
Will old times start to feelin' like new?
When I get there will our love still feel so true?
Yet all I have, I'll be a-bringin' it to you
Oh Bessie, sing them old-time blues

Nothing we can call our own

Well, I'm moving after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I do without it
Without this love we call ours
Beyond here lies nothing
Nothing but the moon and stars

Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
Will keep on loving pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothing
But the mountains of the past

Well, my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head
Beyond here lies nothing
Nothing done and nothing said"

At the end of the rainbow life has only begun
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above

What don't I do?
Through flame and through fire
I'll build my world around you

Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall
Love waits forever, for one and for all

Beyond the horizon, across the divide
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
Down in the valley the water runs cold
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul

My wretched heart is pounding
I felt an angel's kiss
My memories are drowning
In mortal bliss

Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same

Beyond the horizon, the night winds blow
The theme of a melody from many moons ago
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time

It's dark and it's dreary
I've been pleading in vain
I'm wounded, I'm weary
My repentance is plain

Beyond the horizon o'r the treacherous sea
I still can't believe that you have set aside your love for me

Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone

It's the right time of the season
Somebody there always cared
There's always a reason
Why someone's life has been spared

Beyond the horizon, the sky is so blue
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you"

Are gonna flood you big river

And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back
Downstream cavortin' in davenport
And I followed you, big river, when you called

Then you took me to st. Louis later on (down the river)
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in memphis, but she just walked up the block
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by baton rouge, river queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to new orleans, new orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, big river, more than me

Camping out all night on the veranda
Walking in the streets down by the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill the like to send you
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.

There's mills inside the minds of crazy faces
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases
There is always one more notch in four more aces
Billy, and you're playing all alone.

Playing around with some sweet signorita
Into her dark chamber she will greet you
In the shadows of the maizes she will lead you
Billy, and you're going all alone.

They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
So sleep with one eye open, when you wander
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.

There's always another stranger sneaking glances
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul.

The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
So they've hired mister Garrett, he'll force you to slow down
Billy, don't let it make you feel so low down
To be hunted by the man who was your friend.

So hang on to your woman, if you got one
Remember in El Paso once you shot one
I'll be in Santa Fe about one

Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Way down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley

18703,/bob-dylan/,Black Diamond Bay,"Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothin' like that.
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind.
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay.

As the mornin' light breaks open, the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,
Carefully removes his fez,
""Am I hearin' you right?""
And as the yellow fog is liftin'
The Greek is quickly headin' for the second floor.
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinkin' he's the Soviet Ambassador,
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay.

A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doin' business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,
""Can you see anything?""
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,
Says, ""Open up another deck.""
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay.

The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.
He tried to grab the woman's hand,
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""
She said, ""That ain't enough.""
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay.

""I've got to talk to someone quick!""
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.
He hung there from the chandelier.
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near
Please open up the door!""
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love.
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay.

As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.
You can take your money, but I don't know how
You'll spend it in the tomb.""
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay.

I was sittin' home alone one night in L.A.,
Watchin' old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothin' but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes.
Didn't seem like much was happenin',
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.
Seems like every time you turn around
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And there's really nothin' anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay.

Been up all night, have to stay on your guard

The road that you're on
same road that you know
Just not the same as it was a minute ago

Black rider, black rider, you've seen it all
You've seen the great world and you've seen the small
You fell into the fire and you're eating the flame
Better seal up your lips if you wanna stay in the game
Be reasonable, mister, be honest, be fair
Let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer

Black rider, black rider, all dressed in black
I'm walking away, you try to make me look back
My heart is at rest, I'd like to keep it that way
I don't wanna fight, at least not today
Go home to your wife, stop visiting mine
One of these days I'll forget to be kind

Black rider, black rider
tell me when, tell me how
If there ever was a time, then let it be now
Let me go through, open the door
My soul is distressed, my mind is at war
Don't hug me, don't flatter me, don't turn on the charm
I'll take a sword and hack off your arm

Black rider, black rider, hold it right there
The size of your cock will get you nowhere
I'll suffer in silence, I'll not make a sound
Maybe I'll take the high moral ground
Some enchanted evening I'll sing you a song

Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues

As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens

But nobody can sing the blues

Smell that sweet magnolia blooming

With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire

You heard me saying a prayet for someone I really could care for.

And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""

18709,/bob-dylan/,Bob Dylan's 115th Dream,"I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have yuh understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline""
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they are far away at sea

""I think I'll call it America""
I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort
And start buying the place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throw us all in jail
For carryin' harpoons

Ah me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Saying, ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line
Sayin', ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight

I went into a restaurant
Lookin' for the cook
I told them I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some suzette, I said
""Could you please make that crepe""
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boilin' fat
Food was flying everywhere
And I left without my hat

Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again

Well, I rapped upon a house
With the U.S. flag upon display
I said, ""Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way""
The man says, ""Get out of here
I'll tear you limb from limb""
I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too""
He said, ""You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop""
I decided to have him arrested
And I went looking for a cop

I ran right outside
And I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door
This Englishman said, ""Fab""
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And the man asked me who I was

I repeated that my friends
Were all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, ""Call me if they die""
I shook his hand and said goodbye
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
It just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello
This foot came through the line

Well, by this time I was fed up
At tryin' to make a stab
At bringin' back any help
For my friends and Captain Arab
I decided to nip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit
And I got a coin to flip
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship

Well, I got back and took
The parkin' ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
And I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me but
They wanted to know
What exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid

Well, the last I heard of Arab
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships a-sailin'
They were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus
I just said, ""Good luck.""

18710,/bob-dylan/,Bob Dylan's Blues,"Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are ridin' down the line
Fixin' ev'rybody's troubles
Ev'rybody's 'cept mine
Somebody musta tol' 'em
That I was doin' fine

Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothin' in your heads
I got a real gal I'm lovin'
And Lord I'll love her till I'm dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now

Lord, I ain't goin' down to no race track
See no sports car run
I don't have no sports car
And I don't even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block

Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don't step on me

Well, lookit here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes!
"
18711,/bob-dylan/,Bob Dylan's Dream,"While riding on a train goin' west,
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.

With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.

By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Our words were told, our songs were sung,
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.

With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,
We never thought we could ever get old.
We thought we could sit forever in fun
But our chances really was a million to one.

As easy it was to tell black from white,
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And our choices were few and the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.

How many a year has passed and gone,
And many a gamble has been lost and won,
And many a road taken by many a friend,
And each one I've never seen again.

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
"
18712,/bob-dylan/,Boots of Spanish Leather,"Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love,
I'm sailin' away in the morning.
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
From the place that I'll be landing?

No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love,
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'.
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,
From across that lonesome ocean.

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden,
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona.

Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss,
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.

That I might be gone a long time
And it's only that I'm askin',
Is there something I can send you to remember me by,
To make your time more easy passin'.

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,
It only brings me sorrow.
The same thing I want from you today,
I would want again tomorrow.

I got a letter on a lonesome day,
It was from her ship a-sailin',
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again,
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.

Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,
I'm sure your mind is roamin'.
I'm sure your heart is not with me,
But with the country to where you're goin'.

So take heed, take heed of the western wind,
Take heed of the stormy weather.
And yes, there's something you can send back to me,
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.

18713,/bob-dylan/,Born in Time,"In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You're comin' thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams.

You're blowing down the shaky street,
You're hearing my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time.

Bridge #1:
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Not this time baby, no more of this,
Takes too much skill, takes too much will,
It's revealing.
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma,
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reelin' with this feelin'.

On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
You won't get anything you don't deserve
Where we were born in time.

Bridge #2:
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
You hang the flame, you'll pay the price,
Oh babe, that fire
Is still smokin'.
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain,
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken.

In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You can have what's left of me,
Where we were born in time.

One, two, a-one two threeÃ¢â¬Â¦

In the lonely night
In the shadows of a pale moonlight
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams.
I walk alone through the shakin' street,
IÃ¢â¬â¢m a-listenin' to my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time.

Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Not this time, I'll have no more of this.
It's much too cruel, it's much too cool, way too revealing.
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma,
Oh babe, how you left me reelin' with this feelin'.
Up on the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I held you close and got what I deserve
Where we were born in time.

You pressed me once, pressed me twice,
You hang the flame, but you'll pay the price.
Oh babe, and that fire is still smokin'.
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, lord and you were plain,
Oh babe, truer words have never been spoken or broken.
In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You can have what's left of me,
Where we were born in time.

18716,/bob-dylan/,Brownsville Girl,"Well, there was this movie I seen one time,
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.

Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square,
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.

Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart.
The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train.

I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.

Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton'
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.

Well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies,
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul.
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times when I was your only man
And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control.

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love.

Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin' lot outside of town about a mile.
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
She said, ""Henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while.""

Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of bummin' a ride back to where she started.
But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up.
She said, ""Welcome to the land of the living dead."" You could tell she was so broken-hearted.
She said, ""Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt.""

""How far are y'all going?"" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
""We're going all the way 'til the wheels fall off and burn,
'Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies.""
Ruby just smiled and said, ""Ah, you know some babies never learn.""

Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my head
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way.

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love.

Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour.
I was crossin' the street when shots rang out.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
""We got him cornered in the churchyard,"" I heard somebody shout.

Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it, it said, ""A man with no alibi.""
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.

Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Oh if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much. I could feel a whole lot better,
If you were just here by my side to show me how.

Well, I'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind.
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about
But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line.

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love.

You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
And you know there was somethin' about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind in the French Quarter.

Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content.
I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
You always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
And I always said, ""Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on.""

There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice.
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound.
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love.

And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,
If you want me, honey baby,
I'll be here.

Like your smile
And your fingertips
Like the way that you move your lips.
I like the cool way you look at me,
Everything about you is bringing me
Misery.

Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,
When I go.

All ya can do is do what you must.
You do what you must do and ya do it well,
I'll do it for you, honey baby,
Can't you tell?

By and by, I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
While I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time
I'm singin' love's praises with sugar coated rhyme
By and by, on you I'm castin' my eye
I'm paintin' the town, swingin' my partner around
Well I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the road, I'm studyin' the dust

I'm paintin' the town, makin' my last go-round
Well I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin' and I'm walkin' on briars
I'm not even aquainted with my own desires
I'm rollin' slow, I'm doin' all I know
I'm tellin' myself I've found true happiness
That I still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed
I'm rollin' slow goin' where the wild roses grow

Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and you will be my last
Papa gone mad, Mama she's feelin' sad
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I wanna establish my rule through civil war
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be

And another day just drives on through

But that's alright, baby
You know I always understand

Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

All along the homeward way
All my hopes are over the horizon
All my dreams have gone away
The hillside darkly shaded
Stars fall from above
All the joys of earth have faded
The night's untouched by love
I'll be here 'til tomorrow

Beneath a shroud of grey
I pretend I'm free of sorrow
My heart is miles away
The dead bells are ringing
My train is overdue
To your memory I'm clinging
I can't escape from you
Well I hear the sound of thunder

Roaring loud and long
Sometimes you've got to wonder
God knows I've done no wrong
You've wasted all your power
You threw out the christmas pie
Now you're withering like a flower
You'll play the fool and die
I'm neither sad nor sorry
I'm all dressed up in black

I fought for fame and glory
You tried to break my back
In the far off sweet forever
The sunshine peeking through
We should have walked together
I can't escape from you
I cannot grasp the shadows
That gather near the door
Rain falls round my window

I wish I'd seen you more
The path is ever-winding
The stars they never age
The morning light is blinding
All the world's a stage
Should be the time of gladness
Happy faces everywhere
The mystery of madness
Is propagating in the air
I don't like the city
Not like some folks do

Isn't it a pity
I can't escape from you
We ploughed the fields of heaven
Right down to the end
I hope I can be forgiven
If any words of mine offend
All our days were splendid
They were simple, they were plain

It never should have ended
I should have kissed you in the rain
I've been thinking things all over
All the moments full of grace
The primrose and the clover
Your ever-changing face
Can't help looking at you
You made love with God-knows-who
Never found a girl to match you
I can't escape from you"

The air burns and I'm trying to think straight
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

I'm your man; I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate
But I don't know how much longer I can wait

Skies are grey, I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore; I just go
If I ever saw you coming I don't know what I would do
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true
That's how it is when things disintegrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together

It's mighty funny; the end of time has just begun
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one
While I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
But I don't know how much longer I can wait.

She's all in her tender years.
She fell in love with a sailor boy,
It's true she loved him well.
For to go off to sea with him
Like she did not know how,
She longed to see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o.

2. So she bargained with the sailor boy,
All for a piece of gold.
Straightaway then he led her
Down into the hold,
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,
Your jacket shall be blue.
You'll see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o.

3. Now, when the other sailors heard the news,
Well, they fell into a rage,
And with all the ship's company
They were willing to engage.
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,
Overboard we'll throw her.
She'll never see that seaport town
Called Canadee-i-o.

4. Now, when the captain he heard the news,
Well, he too fell in a rage,
And with the whole ship's company
He was willing to engage,
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes,
Her color shall be blue,
She'll see that seaport town
Call Canadee-i-o.

5. Now, when they come down to Canada
Scarcely 'bout half a year,
She's married this bold captain
Who called her his dear.
She's dressed in silks and satins now,
She cuts a gallant show,
Finest of the ladies
Down Canadee-i-o.

6. Come, all you fair and tender girls,
Wheresoever you may be,
I'd have you to follow your own true love
Whene'er he goes to sea.
For if the sailors prove false to you,
Well, the captain, he might prove true.
You'll see the honor I have gained
By the wearing of the blue.

18728,/bob-dylan/,Caribbean Wind,"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.

Was she a child or a woman, I can't say which
From one to another she could to easily switch
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore
She said, ""We got a mutual friend over by the door,
And you know he's got our best interest in mind.""
He was well connected but her heart was a snare
And she had left him to die in there,
There were payments due and he was a little behind.

The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee.""
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,
She said, ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
I hear a voice crying, ""Daddy,"" I always think it's for me,
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Every new messenger brings evil report
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.

Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose.
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin' on.
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,
I saw a house in the country being torn from within.
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

Catfish on the mound.
""Strike three,"" the umpire said,
Batter have to go back and sit down.

Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.

Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm
But the old man wouldn't pay
So he packed his glove and took his arm
An' one day he just ran away.

Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.

Come up where the Yankees are,
Dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Smoke a custom-made cigar,
Wear an alligator boot.

Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.

Love to hunt the little quail.
Got a hundred-acre spread,
Got some huntin' dogs for sale.

Seein' nothin' but the curve,
Swing too early or too late
Got to eat what Catfish serve.

Gonna make the Hall of Fame.

18732,/bob-dylan/,Changing of the Guards,"Sixteen years,
Sixteen banners united over the field
Where the good shepherd grieves.
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.

Fortune calls.
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.

The cold-blooded moon.
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.

They shaved her head.
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.

I stumbled to my feet.
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.

The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.

She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.

Gentlemen, he said,
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.

Peace will come
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

18733,/bob-dylan/,Chimes of Freedom,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
An' the unpawned painter behind his rightful time
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did

He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did

He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did

They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup""
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up

They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
A jeep to drive, blood to spill

They said ""Congratulations, you got what it takes""
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did

He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
The only game he could play was Russian roulette

He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed

He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did

He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
Could've been an accountant or a tennis star

He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay

His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did

Well, everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust

They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about

He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did

18735,/bob-dylan/,Clothesline Saga,"After a while we took in the clothes,
Nobody said very much.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
Which nobody really wanted to touch.
Mama come in and picked up a book
An' Papa asked her what it was.
Someone else asked, ""What do you care?""
Papa said, ""Well, just because.""
Then they started to take back their clothes,
Hang 'em on the line.
It was January the thirtieth
And everybody was feelin' fine.

The next day everybody got up
Seein' if the clothes were dry.
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,
Mama, of course, she said, ""Hi!""
""Have you heard the news?"" he said, with a grin,
""The Vice-President's gone mad!""
""Where?"" ""Downtown."" ""When?"" ""Last night.""
""Hmm, say, that's too bad!""
""Well, there's nothin' we can do about it,"" said the neighbor,
""It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget.""
""Yes, I guess so,"" said Ma,
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.

I reached up, touched my shirt,
And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?""
I said, ""Some of 'em, not all of 'em.""
He said, ""Ya always help out around here with the chores?""
I said, ""Sometime, not all the time.""
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Just as papa yelled outside,
""Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.""
Well, I just do what I'm told,
So, I did it, of course.
I went back in the house and Mama met me
And then I shut all the doors.

Be careful how you court young men
They're like a star on a summer's morning
They'll first appear and then they're gone
They'll tell you some loving story
They'll declare to you their love is true
Then they will go and court some other
And that's the love they have for you

Do you remember our days of courting
When your head lay upon my breast
You could make me believe with falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the west
I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings with which to fly
Right over to see my false true-lover
And when he's talking I'd be nigh

But I'm not a little sparrow
I have no wings with which to fly
So I sit here in grief and sorrow
To weep and pass my troubles by

Swept through the land of
The rich and the free

I look into the eyes
of my merciful friend
And then I ask myself
Is this the end?
Memories linger
Sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will be

Alters are burning
The flames far and wide
the fool has crossed over
from the other side
They tip their caps
from the top of the hill
You can feel them come
All brave blood do spill

Along the dim
Atlantic line
The rapper's land
lasts for miles behind
the lights coming foreward
and the streets are broad
all must yield
To the avenging God

The world is old
The world is great
Lessons of life
Can't be learned in a day
I watch and I wait
And I listen while I stand
To the music that comes
from a far better land

Close the eyes
of our Captain
Peace may he know
His long night is done
The great leader is laid low
He was ready to fall
He was quick to defend
Killed outright he was
by his own men

It's the last day's last hour
of the last happy year
I feel that the unknown
The world is so dear
Pride will vanish
And glory will rot
But virtue lives
and cannot be forgot

The bells
of evening have rung
there's blasphemy
on the end of the tongue
Let them say that I walked
in fair nature's light
And that I was loyal
to truth and to right

Serve God and meet your full
Look upward beyond
Beyond the darkness that masks
the surprises of dawn
In the deep green grasses
and the blood stained woods
They never dreamed of surrendering
They fell where they stood

Stars fell over Alabama
And I saw each star
You're walking in dreams
Whoever you are
Chilled as the skies
Keen as the frost
And the ground's froze hard
And the morning is lost

A letter to mother
came today
Gunshot wound to the breast
is what it did say
But he'll be better soon
He's in a hospital bed
But he'll never be better
He's already dead

And I'm lifted away
In an ancient light

We loved eachother more than
we ever dared to tell"

And I crossed the Rubicon

Well, the Rubicon is a red river
Goin' gently as she flows
Redder than your ruby lips
And the blood that flows from the rose
Three miles north of purgatory
One step from the great beyond
I prayed to the cross, I kissed the girls
And I crossed the Rubicon

What are these dark days I see?
In this world so badly bent
I cannot redeem the time
The time so idly spent
How much longer can it last?
How long can it go on?
I embrace my love
Put down my hair
And I crossed the Rubicon

I can feel the bones beneath my skin
And they're tremblin' with rage
I'll make your wife a widow
You'll never see old age
Show me one good man in sight
That the sun shines down upon
I pawned my watch, I paid my debts
And I crossed the Rubicon

Put my hide up on a hill
Where some happiness I'll find
If I survive, then let me love
Let the hour be mine
Take the high road, take the low
Take any one you're on
I poured a cup, I passed it along
And I crossed the Rubicon

Well, you defiled the most lovely flowers
In all her womanhood
Others can be tolerant
Others can be good
I'll cut you up with a the crooked knife
Lord, I'll miss you when you're gone
I stood between heaven and earth
And I crossed the Rubicon

You won't find any happiness here
No happiness or joy
Go back to the gutter, try your luck
Find you some nice pretty boy
Tell me how many men I need
And who can I count upon
I strapped my belt, I buttoned my coat
And I crossed the Rubicon

I feel the holy spirit inside
See the light that freedom gives
I believe it's in the reach of
Every man who lives
Keep as far away as possible
It's darkest 'fore the dawn (Oh Lord)
I turned the key, I broke it off
And I crossed the Rubicon

Mornin' baby, I used to look my mind
I truly believe that you are
Couldn't be anybody else but you
Who's come with me this far
The killing frost is on the ground
And the autumn leaves are gone
I lit the torch, looked to the east
And I crossed the Rubicon"

I'm longin' for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
I'm goin' t' buy me a barrel of whisky, I'll die before I turn senile
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile?
Well, you bet on the horses, they ran the wrong way

Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes.

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer,
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere.
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes,
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is.
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized,
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel,
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel.
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies,
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

18750,/bob-dylan/,Day of the Locusts,"Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree.
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree.
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
I was ready to leave, I was already walkin',
But the next time I looked there was light in the room.
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin',
The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees.
The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,
Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

I put down my robe, picked up my diploma,
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota,
Sure was glad to get out of there alive.
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
And the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me,
Singing for me, well, singing for me."

I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old

My burden is heavy,

I'm gonna give you all I got to give,
And I do hope you receive it well,
Dependin' on the way you feel that you live.

Dear landlord,
Please heed these words that I speak.
I know you've suffered much,
But in this you are not so unique.
All of us, at times, we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much,
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch.

Dear landlord,
Please don't dismiss my case.
I'm not about to argue,
I'm not about to move to no other place.
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true,
And if you don't underestimate me,
I won't underestimate you.

Just remember that death is no the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When you're standing at the crossroads that you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When the storm clouds gather 'round you, and heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there's no one there to comfort you, with a helpin' hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

Oh, the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines
In dark and empty skies

When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

18756,/bob-dylan/,Desolation Row,"They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
""You Belong to Me I Believe""
And someone says,"" You're in the wrong place, my friend
You better leave""
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortunetelling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid

To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
He looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
""Have Mercy on His Soul""
They all play on penny whistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They're spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words

And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
""Get Outa Here If You Don't Know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row""

Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
""Which Side Are You On?""
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the door knob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them

And his name is Diamond Joe.

In a diamond-studded jar.

With the process of the law.

3. I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,
Did offer him my hand,
He gave a string of horses
So old they could not stand.

4. And I nearly starved to death, boys,
He did mistreat me so,
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe.

5. Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw,

With the waggin' of his jaw.

That could lie like Diamond Joe.

And it's my time to go,
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low

Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
Of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-lou
She said Ã¨Â¥â don't want nobody see me talkin' to you?BR> Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would've got deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn't any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

Footprints runnin' cross the sliver sand
Steps goin' down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the bordertowns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
for dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
To find dignity

You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.

I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.

Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.

There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.

Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?

So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.

Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And we'll leave this ol' highway behind.

Well, the ocean took my baby,
My baby stole my heart from me.
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
My baby took my heart from me.
She packed it all up in a suitcase,

So, I'm a-walkin' down your highway
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.

All the way to the Statue of Liberty."
18768,/bob-dylan/,Dreamin' Of You,"The light
In this place
Is really bad
Like being
In the bottom
Of a stream
Any minute now
I'm expecting
To wake up
From a dream
Miss so much
The softest touch
Like the grave
Of some child child
Who neither wept
Nor smiled
I'm hiding my faith
In the rain
I've been
Dreamin' of you
That's all I do
And it's
Driving me insane

Somewhere dawn
Is breaking
Light is streaking
Across the floor
Church bells
Are ringing
I wonder who
They're ringing for
Travel under any star
You'll see me
Wherever you are
The shadowy past
Is so vague and so vast
I'm sleeping
In the balance of pain
I've been dreamin' of you
That's all I do
But it's
Driving me insane

Maybe they'll get me
Maybe they won't
But whatever
It won't be tonight
I wish your hand
Was in mine right now
We could go
Where the moon is wide
For years
They had me
Locked in a cage
Then they threw me
Onto the stage
Somethings
Just last longer
Then you
Thought they would
And they never
Ever explain
I'm dreamin' of you
That's all I do
And it's
Driving me insane

Well
I eat when I'm hungry
Drink when I'm dry
Live my life
On the square
Even if the flesh
Falls off my face
It won't matter as long
As you're there

Feel like
A ghost in love
Underneath
The heavens above
Feel further away
Then I ever did before
Feel further
Than I can take
Dreamin' of you
That's all I do
But it's
Driving me insane

Everything in the way
Is so shy like the day
In queer and unusual form
Spirals of golden haze here
In there in a blaze
Like beams of light
In a star

Maybe you're here
Or maybe you weren't
Maybe you
Touched somebody
And got burned
The silent sun
Has got me on the run
Burning a hole
In my brain
I'm dreamin' of you
That's all I do
But it's
Driving me insane"
18769,/bob-dylan/,Drifter's Escape,"""Oh, help me in my weakness,""
I heard the drifter say,
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away.
""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one
And my time it isn't long,
And I still do not know
What it was that I've done wrong.""

Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,
A tear came to his eye,
""You fail to understand,"" he said,
""Why must you even try?""
Outside, the crowd was stirring,
You could hear it from the door.
Inside, the judge was stepping down,
While the jury cried for more.

""Oh, stop that cursed jury,""
Cried the attendant and the nurse,
""The trial was bad enough,
But this is ten times worse.""
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape,
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape.

But you're driftin' too far from shore.

Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore

I ain't gonna get lost in this current,
I don't like playing cat and mouse.
No gentleman likes making love to a servant.
Especially when he's in his father's house.

I never could guess your weight, baby,
Never needed to call you my whore.
I always thought you were straight, baby,
But you're driftin' too far from shore.

Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore

Well these times and these tunnels are haunted,
The bottom of the barrel is too.
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.

Never no more do I wonder,
Why you don't never play with me any more.
At any moment you could go under,
'Cause you're driftin' too far from shore.

Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore

You and me we had completeness,
I give you all of what I could provide
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
We were the wrong side.

I've already ripped out the phones, honey.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
I can finish this alone, honey,
You're driftin' too far from shore.

Must be the mother of our lor'

Everybody telling me she's gone to my head

Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead

Blowing through another no good town

The lights on my lady's land are glowing
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb

Blowing like she's blowing right on time"
18773,/bob-dylan/,Early Mornin' Rain,"In the early mornin' rain
with a dollar in my hand
with an achin' in my heart
and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home
and I missed my loved on so
in the early mornin' rain
and no place to go

Out on runway number nine
Big seven-o-seven set to go
well, I'm stuck here on the ground
where the cold winds blow
the liquor tasted good
and the women all were fast
there she goes, my friend
she's a rollin' down at last

Here the mighty engines roar
see the silver bird on high
she's away in westward bound
far above the clouds she'll fly
where the mornin' rain don't fall
and the sun always shines
she'll be flyin' over my home
in about three hours time

This old airports got me down
it's no earthly good to me
'cause I'm stuck here on the ground
cold and drunk as I might be
you can't hop a jet plane
like you can a freight train
so I best be on my way
in the early mornin' rain

In their shark skin suits
Bow ties and buttons
High top boots
Drivin' the spikes in
Blazin' the rails
Nailed in their coffins
Top hats and tails
Fly away over
Fly away flap your wings
Fly by night

They're peddlers and they're meddlers
They buy and they sell
They destroyed your city
They'll destroy you as well

But I will always be emotionally yours.

Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart.
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start.
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm livin' for.
And I will always be emotionally yours.

It's like my whole life never happened,
When I see you, it's as if I never had a thought.
I know this dream, it might be crazy,
But it's the only one I've got.

Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied.
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide.

But I will always be emotionally yours.

18776,/bob-dylan/,Endless Highway,"J. R. Robertson

Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket,
Never let it slip away.
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray.
When ya get half cra-zy from the August heat
Or on a frozen, rotted road
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet.

CHORUS:
You're gonna walk that endless highway,
Walk that high-way till you die.
All you children goin' my way,
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye.

When I see a detour up ahead,
Well, I leave it far behind,
Who knows what you're apt to find there.
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',
Well it look like t'me this time I wont be buyin'

CHORUS

When they get a scapegoat by the throat,
it's hard labour and cold beans.
If ya get away real quick,
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine.
Well, I sing by night, wander by day.
I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay.

18777,/bob-dylan/,Eternal Circle,"I sang the song slowly
As she stood in the shadows
She stepped to the light
As my silver strings spun
She called with her eyes
To the tune I's a-playin'
But the song it was long
And I'd only begun

Through a bullet of light
Her face was reflectin'
The fast fading words
That rolled from my tongue
With a long-distance look
Her eyes was on fire
But the song it was long
And there was more to be sung.

My eyes danced a circle
Across her clear outline
With her head tilted sideways
She called me again
As the tune drifted out
She breathed hard through the echo
But the song it was long
And it was far to the end

I glanced at my guitar
And played it pretendin'
That of all the eyes out there
I could see none
As her thoughts pounded hard
Like the pierce of an arrow
But the song it was long
And it had to get done

As the tune finally folded
I laid down the guitar
Then looked for the girl
Who'd stayed for so long
But her shadow was missin'
For all of my searchin'
So I picked up my guitar
And began the next song

18778,/bob-dylan/,Eve of Destruction,"The eastern world it is explodin',
Violence flarin', bullets loadin',
You're old enough to kill but not for votin',
You don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin',
And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin',
But you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

Don't you understand, what I'm trying to say?
Can't you see the fear that I'm feeling today?
If the button is pushed, there's no running away,
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave,
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy,
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin',
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin',
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation,
Handful of Senators don't pass legislation,
And marches alone can't bring integration,
When human respect is disintegratin',
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin',
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

Think of all the hate there is in Red China!
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama!
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space,
But when your return, it's the same old place,
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace,
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace,
Hate your next-door-neighbour, but don't forget to say grace,
And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend,
you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

18779,/bob-dylan/,Every Grain of Sand,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.

Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.

Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.

I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name.
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.

I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.

I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.

Everybody must get stoned

Well They'll stone you and say that it's the end
They'll stone you and then they'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing you guitar
Yes But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say they're all brave
They'll stone you when you're send down in your grave

Broken bottles, broken plates,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Everything is broken.

Bridge: Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground

Broken cutters, broken saws,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Broken voices on broken phones.
Take a deep breath, feel like you're chokin',
Everything is broken.

Bridge: Every time you leave and go off someplace

Broken treaties, broken vows,
Broken pipes, broken tools,

Another ship goin' out
Another day of anger, bitterness, and doubt
I know how it happened
I saw it begin
I opened my heart to the world and the world came in

Hello Mary Lou
Hello Miss Pearl
My fleet-footed guides from the underworld
No stars in the sky shine brighter than you
You girls mean business and I do too

Well I'm the enemy of treason
Enemy of strife
Enemy of the unlived meaningless life
I ain't no false prophet
I just know what I know
I go where only the lonely can go

I'm first among equals
Second to none
Last of the best
You can bury the rest
Bury 'em naked with their silver and gold
Put them six feet under and pray for their souls

What are you lookin' at
There's nothing to see
Just a cool breeze that's encircling me
Let's go for a walk in the garden
So far and so wide
We can sit in the shade by the fountain-side

I search the world over
For the Holy Grail
I sing songs of love
I sing songs of betrayal
Don't care what I drink
Don't care what I eat
I climbed the mountains of swords on my bare feet

You don't know me darlin'
You never would guess
I'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
I ain't no false prophet
I just said what I said
I'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head

Put out your hand
There's nothing to hold
Open your mouth
I'll stuff it with gold
Oh you poor devil look up if you will
The city of God is there on the hill

Hello stranger
A long goodbye
You ruled the land
But so do I
You lost your mule
You got a poison brain
I'll marry you to a ball and chain

You know darlin'
The kind of life that I live
When your smile meets my smile something's got to give
I ain't no false prophet
No I'm nobody's bride
Can't remember when I was born
And I forgot when I died"

The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits

The triangle tingles
And the trumpet play slow
Farewell Angelina

And I must go.

There's no need for anger
There's no need for blame
There's nothing to prove
Ev'rything's still the same
Just a table standing empty
By the edge of the sea
Farewell Angelina
The sky is trembling
And I must leave.

The jacks and queens
Have forsaked the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce
And the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina
The sky is folding
I'll see you in a while.

See the cross-eyed pirates sitting
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans
With a sawed-off shotgun
And the neighbors they clap
And they cheer with each blast
Farewell Angelina
The sky's changing color
And I must leave fast.

King Kong, little elves
On the rooftoops they dance
Valentino-type tangos
While the make-up man's hands
Shut the eyes of the dead
Not to embarrass anyone
Farewell Angelina
The sky is embarrassed
And I must be gone.

The machine guns are roaring
The puppets heave rocks
The fiends nail time bombs
To the hands of the clocks
Call me any name you like
I will never deny it
Farewell Angelina
The sky is erupting
I must go where it's quiet.

18788,/bob-dylan/,Floater (Too Much To Ask),"Words and music by Bob Dylan

Down over the window
From the dazzling sunlit place
Through the back alleys, through the blinds
Another one of the Memphis days

Honey bees are buzzing
Leaves begin to stir
I'm in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her

I keep listening for footsteps
But I ain't never hearing any
From the boat, I fish for bullheads
I catch a lot, sometimes too many

A summer breeze is blowin'
A squall is setting in
Sometimes it's just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind

Well the old men 'round here
Sometimes they get on bad terms
With the younger men,
Old, young, age don't carry weight
It doesn't matter in the end

One of the boss' hangers-on
Sometimes comes to call
At times you least expect
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,
Inspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect

There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
The other one is long gone
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across
Burns with the bark still on

They say times are hard
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere
We'll just have to see how it goes

My old man, he's like some feudal lord
He's got more lives than a cat
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Things come alive or they fall flat

You can smell the pine wood burnin'
You can hear the school bell ring
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can
If you wanna learn anything

Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion
That don't give your appearance a very youthful touch
Juliet said back to Romeo,
Why don't you just shove off,
If it bothers you so much

They all got outta here any way they could
Cold rain can give you the shivers
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,
All the rest of them rebel rivers

If you ever try to interfere with me
Or cross my path again,
You do so at the peril of your life
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound
I've seen enough heartache and strife

My grandfather was a duck trapper,
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes

I had 'em once, though I suppose
To go along with all the ring dancing,
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves

Not always easy kicking someone out
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And tears or not, it's too much to ask

"

So can a woman who passes herself off as a male

Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn
in these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

There's a retired businessman named Red, cast down from heaven and he's out of his head
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
He's not somebody that you play around with much
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
She'll do wondrous works with your fate
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
Sing ""Amazing Grace"" all the way to the Swiss banks

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

They got some beautiful people out there, man
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don't believe in mercy
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

Yes, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid
From now on, this'll be where you're from
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

Now you're content to let the days go by
When you were there
You were the answer to my prayer

Forgetful heart
We loved with all the love that life can give
What can I say
Without you it's so hard to live
Can't take much more
Why can't we love like we did before

Like a walking shadow in my brain
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
The door has closed forevermore
If indeed there ever was a door"

Think I'll go down to alberta
Where there's good there in the fall

Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge
I'm cracked up on the highway and on the water's edge
She comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead

Well, you know I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead

The moon is there for us to share
But where are you?

A night like this could weave a memory
And every kiss could start a dream for two

Full moon and empty arms
Tonight, I'll use the magic moon
To wish upon

And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with you

If my one wish comes true

18798,/bob-dylan/,Gates of Eden,"Of war and peace the truth just twists
Its curfew gull just glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

The lamppost stands with folded arms
Its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle black madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

The kingdoms of Experience
In the precious wind they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly, totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds

Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
That's the way I remember her best

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room
With a golden loom.

First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
With your golden loom.

I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom.

Women in the churches wear powder and paint
Where the Jews, and Catholics, and the Muslims all pray
I can tell they're Proddie from a mile away
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, Jimmy Reed indeed
Give me that old time religion, it's just what I need

For thine is kingdom, the power, the glory
Go tell it on the mountain, go tell the real story
Tell it in that straightforward, puritanical tone
In the mystic hours when a person's alone
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, godspeed
Thump on the Bible, proclaim a creed

You won't amount to much, the people all said
'Cause I didn't play guitar behind my head
Never pandered, never acted proud
Never took off my shoes, throw 'em in the crowd
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, goodnight
Put a jewel in your crown and I put out the lights

They threw everything at me, everything in the book
I had nothing to fight
with but a butcher's hook
They had no pity, they never lend a hand
I can't sing a song that I don't understand
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, good luck
I can't play the record 'cause my needle got stuck

Transparent woman in a transparent dress
Suits you well, I must confess
I'll break open your grapes, I'll suck out the juice
I need you like my head needs a noose
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and so long
I thought I could resist her but I was so wrong

God be with you, brother dear
If you don't mind me asking what brings you here?
Oh, nothing much, I'm just looking for the man
Need to see where he's lying in this lost land
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, and everything within ya
Can't you hear me calling from down in Virginia?"

Someone's watchin' over you.

Look the other way.

18810,/bob-dylan/,Grand Coulee Dam,"Well the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell.
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well.
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land.
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam.

She come up the Canadian Rockies where the crystal waters glide,
Comes a-roaring down the canyon to meet that salty tide
From the great Pacific Ocean to where the sun sets in the west,
That big Grand Coulee country in that land I love the best.

In the misty glitter of that wild and windward spray,
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave.
Once she tore men's boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream,
That day that Grand Coulee dam went across that wild and restless stream.

Oh Uncle Sam took up the notion in the year of thirty three,
For the factory and the farmer and for all of you and me.
He said: roll it on Columbia, you can roll out to the sea
But river, while you're rolling you can do some work for me.

Now from Washington and Oregon you can hear them factories a-hum,
Making corn and making mangonies lying all over the ground.
Always a flying fortress to blast for Uncle Sam,
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee dam.

Well, I wish I was in London,
Or some other seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat
I'd sail the ocean 'round.

While sailing 'round the ocean,
While sailing 'round the sea
I'd think of handsome Molly
Wherever she might be.

Don't you remember, Molly
You gave me your right hand?
You said whenever you'd marry
I would be the man.

But you broke your promise
Go with whom you please
My poor heart is aching
You are at your ease.

I went to church last Sunday
Molly came ridin' by
I could tell her mind was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye.

I go down to the river
Though everyone's asleep
I think of handsome Molly
An' I begin to weep.

So I wish I was in London,
Or some other seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat
I'd sail the ocean 'round.

18814,/bob-dylan/,Hard Times,"1. Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

2. While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.

With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.

Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong.
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
""Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
It's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.

Old New York City is a friendly old town,
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
It's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.

It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
To Rockefeller Plaza n' the Empire State.
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,
Old Mister Empire never says a word.
It's hard times from the country,
Livin' down in New York town.

Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
And it's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.

Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.
Bought your city on a one-way track,
'F I had my way I'd sell it right back.
And it's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.

I'll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay,
'N' every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,
'N' the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
And it's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.

So all you newsy people, spread the news around,
You c'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.
You c'n step on my name, you c'n try 'n' get me beat,
When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet.
And it's hard times in the city,
Livin' down in New York town.

Bells are ringing, children singing;
All is merry and bright.

'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

18820,/bob-dylan/,Highlands,"Well my heart's in the Highlands gentle and fair
Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air
Bluebelles blazing, where the Aberdeen waters flow
Well my heart's in the Highland,
I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go

Windows were shakin' all night in my dreams
Everything was exactly the way that it seems
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page
Same ol' rat race
Life in the same ol' cage.

I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
I wish someone would come
And push back the clock for me

Well my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam
That's where I'll be when I get called home
The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme
Well my heart's in the Highland,
I can only get there one step at a time.

I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound
Someone's always yelling turn it down
Feel like I'm drifting
Drifting from scene the scene
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?

Insanity is smashing up against my soul
You can say I was on anything but a roll
If I had a conscience, well I just might blow my top
What would I do with it anyway
Maybe take it to the pawn shop

My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan
Big white clouds, like chariots that swing down low
Well my heart's in the Highlands
Only place left to go

I'm in Boston town, in some restaurant
I got no idea what I want
Well, maybe I do but I'm just really not sure
Waitress comes over
Nobody in the place but me and her

It must be a holiday, there's nobody around
She studies me closely as I sit down
She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs
She says, ""What'll it be?""
I say, ""I don't know, you got any soft boiled eggs?""

She looks at me, Says ""I'd bring you some
but we're out of 'm, you picked the wrong time to come""
Then she says, ""I know you're an artist, draw a picture of me!""
I say, ""I would if I could, but,
I don't do sketches from memory.""

""Well"", she says, ""I'm right here in front of you, or haven't you looked?""
I say,"" all right, I know, but I don't have my drawing book!""
She gives me a napkin, she says, ""you can do it on that""
I say, ""yes I could but,
I don't know where my pencil is at!""

She pulls one out from behind her ear
She says ""all right now, go ahead, draw me, I'm standing right here""
I make a few lines, and I show it for her to see
Well she takes a napkin and throws it back
And says ""that don't look a thing like me!""

I said, ""Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does""
She says, ""you must be jokin.'"" I say, ""I wish I was!""
Then she says, ""you don't read women authors, do you?""
Least that's what I think I hear her say,
""Well"", I say, ""how would you know and what would it matter anyway?""

""Well"", she says, ""you just don't seem like you do!""
I said, ""you're way wrong.""
She says, ""which ones have you read then?"" I say, ""I read Erica Jong!""
She goes away for a minute and I slide up out of my chair
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere

Well my heart's in the Highlands, with the horses and hounds
Way up in the border country, far from the towns
With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow
My heart's in the Highlands
Can't see any other way to go

Every day is the same thing out the door
Feel further away then ever before
Some things in life, it gets too late to learn
Well, I'm lost somewhere
I must have made a few bad turns

I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright colored clothes
All the young men with their young women looking so good
Well, I'd trade places with any of them
In a minute, if I could

I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog
Talking to myself in a monologue
I think what I need might be a full length leather coat
Somebody just asked me
If I registered to vote

The sun is beginning to shine on me
But it's not like the sun that used to be
The party's over, and there's less and less to say
I got new eyes
Everything looks far away

Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day
Over the hills and far away
There's a way to get there, and I'll figure it out somehow
But I'm already there in my mind
And that's good enough for now

Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town
Reformation shook it, broke it, then she hung it on the wall
Say you dancin' with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all

I got a craven love for blazin' speed
I got a hopped up Mustang Ford

Coffins droppin' in the street like balloons made out of lead
Water poured into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do

Well, George Lewes told the Englishman, the Italian and the Jew
You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway 5

Well, the cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies
I'm preachin' the word of God, I'm puttin' out your eyes
I asked Fat Nancy for someth'n' to eat, she said take it off the shelf
As great as you are man, you'll never be greater than yourself
I told her I didn't really care
Highwater everywhere

I get up in the mornin', I believe I'll dust my broom
Keepin' away from the women, I'm givin' them lots of room
Thunder rollin' over Clarksdale, everythin' a-lookin' blue
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too
It's bad out there

Just take everything down to Highway 61.

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm

But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

""Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter
I'm weepin' for my babies three.""

Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
They look as white as snow
Those are the hill of heaven, my love
You and I'll never know

Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
They look as dark as night
Those are the hills of hell-fire my love
Where you and I will unite

Oh twice around went the gallant ship
I'm sure it was not three
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea
"
18827,/bob-dylan/,House of the Rising Sun,"(First releaseÃ¢â¬âTraditional, arranged by Bob Dylan)

There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh God, I'm a-one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim
And he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin' from town to town

Oh tell my baby sister
Not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun

Well, it's one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

I'm a-goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm goin' back to end my life
Down in the Risin' Sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun
It's been the ruin of many poor girl
And me, oh God, I'm a-one
"
18828,/bob-dylan/,Huck's Tune,"Well I wandered alone
Through a desert of stone
And I dreamt of my future wife
My sword's in my hand
And I'm next in command
In this version of death called life
My plate and my cup
Are right straight up

I took a rose from the hand of a child
When I kiss your lips
The honey drips
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while
Every day we meet
On any old street
And you're in your girlish prime

The short and the tall
Are coming to the ball
I go there all the time
Behind every tree
There's something to see
The river is wider than a mile
I tried you twice
You can't be nice

I'm gonna have to put you down for a while
Here come the nurse
With money in her purse
Here come the ladies and men
You push it all in
And you've no chance to win
You play 'em on down to the end

I'm laying in the sand
Getting a sunshine tan
Moving along, riding in style
From my toes to my head
You knock me dead
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while
I count the years
And I shed no tears
I'm blinded to what might have been

Nature's voice
Makes my heart rejoice
Play me the wild song of the wind
I found hopeless love
In the room above
When the sun and the weather were riled
You're as fine as wine
I ain't handing you no line
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

All the merry little elves
Can go hang themselves
My faith is as cold as can be
I'm stacked high to the roof
And I'm not without proof
If you don't believe me, come see
You think I'm blue

I think so, too
In my words you'll find no guile
The game's gotten old
The deck's gone cold
And I'm gonna have to
Put you down for a while
The game's gotten old
The deck's gone cold
And I'm gonna have to
Put you down for a while"
18829,/bob-dylan/,I Am a Lonesome Hobo,"I am a lonesome hobo
Without family or friends,
Where another man's life might begin,
That's exactly where mine ends.
I have tried my hand at bribery,
Blackmail and deceit,
And I've served time for ev'rything
'Cept beggin' on the street.

Well, once I was rather prosperous,
There was nothing I did lack.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
And silk upon my back.
But I did not trust my brother,
I carried him to blame,
Which led me to my fatal doom,
To wander off in shame.

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen,
Soon I will be gone,
But let me just warn you all,
Before I do pass on;
Stay free from petty jealousies,
Live by no man's code,
And hold your judgment for yourself
Lest you wind up on this road."
18830,/bob-dylan/,I and I,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

Think I'll go out and go for a walk,
Not much happenin' here, nothin' ever does.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk
I got nothin' to say, 'specially about whatever was.

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race,
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

Outside of two men on a train platform there's nobody in sight,
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's all right.
She should still be there sleepin' when I get back.

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

Noontime, and I'm still pushin' myself along the road, the darkest part,
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Someone else is speakin' with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot.

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives.
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
"
18831,/bob-dylan/,I Believe in You,"They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know I'll make it through.
And they, they look at me and frown,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
They don't want me around
'Cause I believe in you.

They show me to the door,
They say don't come back no more
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to,
And I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I don't feel alone
'Cause I believe in you.

I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
I believe in you even though we be apart.
I believe in you even on the morning after.
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
Oh, when the night is disappearing
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.

Don't let me drift too far,
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed.
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you.

I believe in you when winter turn to summer,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered.
Oh, though the earth may shake me
Oh, though my friends forsake me
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.

Don't let me change my heart,
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue.
And I, I don't mind the pain
Don't mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain
'Cause I believe in you.
"
18832,/bob-dylan/,I Can't Come In With a Broken Heart,"Well I go get broke down, before I bust down
Gotta get in without a broken heart well
Get a hoe down before a low down
Before my guilt is acid hot
Well every single morning
I can't take it no more
Well if you with a heartache
Go down baby
She don't care about that us apart
Well she gonna have 'em, but she won't invite me
But I can't come in with a broken heart
I hold down, can't come down
Is comin' in without a broken heart
Well you cheated, showed her down
But I don't come around
O when she'll take ya tear us apart"
18833,/bob-dylan/,I Contain Multitudes,"Today, tomorrow, and yesterday, too
The flowers are dyin' like all things do
Follow me close, I'm going to Balian Bali
I'll lose my mind if you don't come with me
I fuss with my hair, and I fight blood feuds
I contain multitudes

Got a tell-tale heart, like Mr. Poe
Got skeletons in the walls of people you know
I'll drink to the truth and the things we said
I'll drink to the man that shares your bed
I paint landscapes, and I paint nudes
I contain multitudes

Red Cadillac and a black mustache
Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash
Tell me, what's next? What shall we do?
Half my soul, baby, belongs to you
I relic and I frolic with all the young dudes
I contain multitudes

I'm just like Anne Frank, like Indiana Jones
And them British bad boys, The Rolling Stones
I go right to the edge, I go right to the end
I go right where all things lost are made good again
I sing the songs of experience like William Blake
I have no apologies to make
Everything's flowing all at the same time
I live on the boulevard of crime
I drive fast cars, and I eat fast foods
I contain multitudes

Pink petal-pushers, red blue jeans
All the pretty maids, and all the old queens
All the old queens from all my past lives
I carry four pistols and two large knives
I'm a man of contradictions
I'm a man of many moods
I contain multitudes

You greedy old wolf, I'll show you my heart
But not all of it, only the hateful part
I'll sell you down the river, I'll put a price on your head
What more can I tell you?
I sleep with life and death in the same bed
Get lost, madame, get up off my knee
Keep your mouth away from me
I'll keep the path open, the path in my mind
I'll see to it that there's no love left behind
I'll play Beethoven's sonatas, and Chopin's preludes
I contain multitudes"
18834,/bob-dylan/,I Could Have Told You,"I could have told you
She'd hurt you
She'd love you a while
Then desert you
If only you asked
I could have told you so

I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love
And didn't want to know

I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep

And soon it's over
And done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so

I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises
She'll never keep

And soon it's over
And done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so"
18835,/bob-dylan/,I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met),"I can't understand,
She let go of my hand
An' left me here facing the wall.
I'd sure like t' know
Why she did go,
But I can't get close t' her at all.
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime,
She said she would never forget.
But now mornin's clear,
It's like I ain't here,
She just acts like we never have met.

It's all new t' me,
Like some mystery,
It could even be like a myth.
Yet it's hard t' think on,
That she's the same one
That last night I was with.
From darkness, dreams're deserted,
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once an' talk,
'Stead of acting like we never have met.

If she ain't feelin' well,
Then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back t' my face?
Without any doubt,
She seems too far out
For me t' return t' her chase.
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling,
I remember her whispering yet.
But evidently she don't
An' evidently she won't,
She just acts like we never have met.

If I didn't have t' guess,
I'd gladly confess
T' anything I might've tried.
If I was with 'er too long
Or have done something wrong,
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide.
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played,
Her mouth was watery and wet.
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same,
She just acts like we never have met.

I'm leavin' today,
I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much.
But if you want me to,
I can be just like you
An' pretend that we never have touched.
An' if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?""
I'll say, ""It's easily done,
You just pick anyone,
An' pretend that you never have met!""
"
18836,/bob-dylan/,I Don't Hurt Anymore,"I don't hurt anymore
All my teardrops are dry
No more walking the floor
With that burning inside
Just to think it could be
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free
I don't hurt anymore

Oh, you still deny
I wanted to die
The day taht you said we were through
But now that I find
You're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore

No use to deny
I wanted to die
The day that you said we were through
But now that I find
You're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore"
18837,/bob-dylan/,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
Alive as you or me,
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery,
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold,
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold.

""Arise, arise,"" he cried so loud,
In a voice without restraint,
""Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint.
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own,
So go on your way accordingly
But know you're not alone.""

I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
Alive with fiery breath,
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death.
Oh, I awoke in anger,
So alone and terrified,
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried.
"
18838,/bob-dylan/,I Feel A Change Comin' On,"Well, I'm looking the world over
Looking far off into the east
And I see my baby coming
She's walking whith the village priest

I feel a change comin' on
And the last part of the days
already gone

We got so much in common
We strive for the same old ends
And I just can't wait
Wait for us to become friends

I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already
gone

Well, life is for love
And They say that love is blind
If you wanna live easy
Baby, pack your clothes with mine

I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already
gone

Well,now what's the use of dreaming'?
You got better thing to do
Dreams never did work for me anyway
Even when they did come true

You are as whorish as ever
Baby, you can't start a fire
I must be losin' my mind
You're the object of my desire

I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already
gone

I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver
And I'm reading James Joyce
Some people, they tell me
I've got the blood of the land in my voice

Everybody got all the money
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes
Everybody got all the flowers
I don't have one single rose

I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already
gone"
18839,/bob-dylan/,I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know,"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.

You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
"
18840,/bob-dylan/,I Shall Be Free,"Well, I took me a woman late last night,
I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""
I hot-footed it . . bare-naked . .
Out the window!

Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
(Right there
Proud as can be)

I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed
When a can a black paint it fell on my head.
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
(Cost a quarter
And I had to get out quick . .
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)

Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.""
(Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)

Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.
Licks my face and tickles my ear,
Bends me over and buys me beer.
(She's a honeymooner
A June crooner
A spoon feeder
And a natural leader)

Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,
I got a woman who works on the levee.
Pumping that water up to her neck,
Every week she sends me a monthly check.
(She's a humdinger
Folk singer
Dead ringer
For a thing-a-muh jigger)

Late one day in the middle of the week,
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.
I chased me a woman up the hill,
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.
It was Little Bo Peep!
(I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a bean stalk
I jumped a ferris wheel)

Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.
(He's eatin' bagels
He's eatin' pizza
He's eatin' chitlins
He's eatin' bullshit!)

Oh, set me down on a television floor,
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.
(It's that greasy kid stuff.
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,
Charles de Gaulle
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)

Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.
(She's a little bit heavy!)

Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,
It levels my head and eases my mind.
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
I see better days and I do better things.
(I catch dinosaurs
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor . .
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)
"
18841,/bob-dylan/,I Shall Be Free No.10,"I'm just average, common too
I'm just like him, the same as you
I'm everybody's brother and son
I ain't different from anyone
It ain't no use a-talking to me
It's just the same as talking to you.

I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay
I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen.""

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
The streets in heaven are lined with gold
I ask you how things could get much worse
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Wowee' pretty scary!

Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree
I want ev'rybody to be free
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door and marry my daughter
You must think I'm crazy!
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.

Well, I set my monkey on the log
And ordered him to do the Dog
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And he went and did the Cat instead
He's a weird monkey, very funky.

I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And my wig-hat was falling in my face
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.

I gotta woman, she's so mean
She sticks my boots in the washing machine
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude
Puts bubblegum in my food
She's funny, wants my money, calls me ""honey.""

Now I gotta friend who spends his life
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
I've got a million friends!

Now they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sister's home
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
I wound up with the Dean of Women
Yippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.
Hope I don't blow it.

I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So I look like a walking mountain range
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.

Now you're probably wondering by now
Just what this song is all about
What's probably got you baffled more
Is what this thing here is for.
It's nothing
It's something I learned over in England.
"
18842,/bob-dylan/,I Shall Be Released,"They say ev'rything can be replaced,
Yet ev'ry distance is not near.
So I remember ev'ry face
Of ev'ry man who put me here.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

They say ev'ry man needs protection,
They say ev'ry man must fall.
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him shout so loud,
Crying out that he was framed.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.
"
18843,/bob-dylan/,I Threw It All Away,"I once held her in my arms,
She said she would always stay.
But I was cruel,
I treated her like a fool,
I threw it all away.

Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.
I must have been mad,
I never knew what I had,
Until I threw it all away.

Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Love and only love, it can't be denied.
No matter what you think about it
You just won't be able to do without it.
Take a tip from one who's tried.

So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,
For one thing that's certain,
You will surely be a-hurtin',
If you throw it all away."
18844,/bob-dylan/,I Wanna Be Your Lover,"Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand
And the judge says, ""Mona can't have no bond.""
And the walls collide, Mona cries,
And the rainman leaves in the wolfman's disguise.

I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man.
I wanna be your lover, baby,
I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours.

Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit
Says to the masked man, ""Ain't you cute!""
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf
And he says, ""You ain't so bad yourself.""

I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man.
I wanna be your lover, baby,
I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours.

Well, jumpin' Judy can't go no higher.
She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire.
Rasputin he's so dignified,
He touched the back of her head an' he died.

I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man.
I wanna be your lover, baby,
I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours.

Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Stretchin' out upon the grass.
She gets all messed up and she faints
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't.

I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man.
I wanna be your lover, baby,
I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours.

18845,/bob-dylan/,I Want You,"The guilty undertaker sighs,
The lonesome organ grinder cries,
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn,
But it's not that way,
I wasn't born to lose you.
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep,
They wait for you.
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin' from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you.
I want you, I want you,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

Now all my fathers, they've gone down
True love they've been without it.
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don't think about it.

Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid.
She knows that I'm not afraid
To look at her.
She is good to me
And there's nothing she doesn't see.
She knows where I'd like to be
But it doesn't matter.
I want you, I want you,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
He spoke to me, I took his flute.
No, I wasn't very cute to him,
Was I?
But I did it because he lied
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
And because I . .
I want you, I want you,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you."
18846,/bob-dylan/,I'll Be Your Baby Tonight,"Close your eyes, close the door,
You don't have to worry any more.
I'll be your baby tonight.

Shut the light, shut the shade,
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll be your baby tonight.

Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away,
We're gonna forget it.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,
But we're gonna let it,
You won't regret it.

Kick your shoes off, do not fear,
Bring that bottle over here.
I'll be your baby tonight.

Quicker than anyone I knew.
When I'm all alone

I had so much left to do,
I had so little time to fail.
There's some people that
You don't forget,
Even though you've only seen'm
One time or two.
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade,
I'll remember you.

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?

I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
It was you who came right through,
It was you who understood.
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to.

A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss, not mine alone
To share a kiss that devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say

And the day makes her lonely
And it's so hard to buck, I was there

I believe that she'd stop him if she would start to care
I believe that she'd look upon this side
And t' care and I'd go by the something
When she's on my way, but I don't belong there

No I don't belong to her
I don't belong to anybody
She's my prize forsaken angel
But she don't care she cries
She's a lone-hearted mystic and she can carry on

When I'm there, she's all right
But she's not when I'm gone
Heaven knows that the answer she's don't call in no one
She's a wave, a thing, beautiful she's mine for the one

And I'm also hesitating by temptation lest it runs
Which it don't follow me
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Now I'll cry tonight, like I cried the night before
And I'll feast on her eyes
But I'll dream about the door
So long, Jesus, savior, blind faith worth to tell
It don't have consolation she's my

I was born to love her
But she knows that the kingdom waits so high above her
And I run but I race
But it's not too fast a pace

I saw the first fall of snow
I saw the flowers come and go
I don't think that anyone ever has ever knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

I'm giving myself to you, I am
From Salt Lake City to Birmingham
From East L. A. to San Antone
I don't think I can bear to live my life alone

My eye's like a shooting star
It looks at nothin' here or there, looks at nothin' near of far
No one ever told me, it's just something I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

If I had the wings of a snow white dove
I'd preach the gospel, the gospel of love
A love so real, a love so true
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

Take me on traveling, you're a traveling man
Show me something I don't understand
I'm not what I was, things aren't what they were
I'll go far away from home with her

I've traveled a long road of despair
I've met no other traveler there
Lot of people gone, a lot of people I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

Well, my heart's like a river, a river that sings
Just takes me a while to realize things
I've seen the sunrise, I've seen the dawn
I'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone

I've traveled from the mountains to the sea
I hope that the gods go easy with me

18853,/bob-dylan/,Idiot Wind,"Someone's got it in for me,
they're planting stories in the press
Whoever it is

They say I shot a man named Gray
and took his wife to Italy,
She inherited a million bucks
and when she died it came to me.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.

People see me all the time
and they just can't remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas,
images and distorted facts.
Even you, yesterday
you had to ask me where it was at,
I couldn't believe
after all these years,
you didn't know me better than that
Sweet lady.

Idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your mouth,
Blowing down the backroads headin' south.
Idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.

I ran into the fortune-teller,
who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long
I can't remember what it's like.
There's a lone soldier on the cross
smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door
You didn't know it,
you didn't think it could be done,
in the final end he won the wars
After losin' every battle.

I woke up on the roadside,
daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
shoot through my head
and are makin' me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best
and cover up the truth with lies.
One day you'll be in the ditch,
flies buzzin' around your eyes,
Blood on your saddle.

Idiot wind,
blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Blowing through the curtains in your room.
Idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.

It was gravity which pulled us down
and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage
but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.
Now everything's a little upside down,
as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped,
What's good is bad, what's bad is good,
you'll find out when you reach the top
You're on the bottom.

I noticed at the ceremony,
your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can't remember your face anymore,
your mouth has changed
your eyes don't look into mine.
The priest wore black on the seventh day
and sat stone-faced while
the building burned.
I waited for you on the running boards,
near the cypress trees,
while the springtime turned Slowly into autumn.

Idiot wind,
blowing like a circle around my skull,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.
Idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.

I can't feel you anymore,
I can't even touch the books you've read
Every time I crawl past your door,
I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.
Down the highway, down the tracks,
down the road to ecstasy,
I followed you beneath the stars,
hounded by your memory
And all your ragin' glory.

I been double-crossed now for the very last time
and now I'm finally free,
I kissed goodbye
the howling beast on the borderline
which separated you from me.
You'll never know the hurt
I suffered nor the pain I rise above,
And I'll never know the same about you,
your holiness or your kind of love,
And it makes me feel so sorry.

Idiot wind,
blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.
Idiot wind,
blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
We're idiots, babe.
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves."

18864,/bob-dylan/,Isis,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
But I could not hold on to her very long.
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.

I came to a high place of darkness and light.
The dividing line ran through the center of town.
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.

A man in the corner approached me for a match.
I knew right away he was not ordinary.
He said, ""Are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?""
I said, ""I got no money."" He said, ""That ain't necessary.""

We set out that night for the cold in the North.
I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word.
I said, ""Where are we goin'?"" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I said, ""That's the best news that I've ever heard.""

I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold,
I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace.
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.

How she told me that one day we would meet up again,
And things would be different the next time we wed,
If I only could hang on and just be her friend.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.

We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice.
He said, ""There's a body I'm tryin' to find.
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price.""
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.

The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious,
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.

I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had.
When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly,
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.

I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.

She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed,
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes.
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.

She said, ""Where ya been?"" I said, ""No place special.""
She said, ""You look different."" I said, ""Well, I guess.""
She said, ""You been gone."" I said, ""That's only natural.""
She said, ""You gonna stay."" I said, ""If you want me to, yes.""

I'm not the one you want, babe,
I will only let you down.
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Someone to close his heart,
Someone who will die for you an' more,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Go melt back into the night, babe,
Everything inside is made of stone.
There's nothing in here moving
An' anyway I'm not alone.
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
To gather flowers constantly
An' to come each time you call,
A lover for your life an' nothing more,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

""I have to wait""

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around
And finally found
The somebody who
Could make me be true
And could make me be blue
And even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinking of you

Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do

For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you

Throw on the dirt, pile on the dust

All good

Big politician telling lies
Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies
Don't make a bit of difference, don't see why it should
But it's all right, 'cause it's all good
It's all good
It's all good

Wives are leavin' their husbands, they beginning to roam
They leave the party and they never get home
I wouldn't change it, even if I could
You know what they say man, it's all good
It's all good

Brick by brick, they tear you down
A teacup of water is enough to drown
You ought to know, if they could they would
Whatever going down, it's all good
All good
Say it's all good

People in the country, people on the land
Some of them so sick, they can hardly stand
Everybody would move away, if they could
It's hard to believe but it's all good
Yeah

Everywhere you look, more misery
Come along with me, babe, I wish you would
You know what I'm sayin', it's all good
All good
I said it's all good

Cold-blooded killer, stalking the town
Cop cars blinking, something bad going down
Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
But there's nothing to worry about, 'cause it's all good
It's all good
They say it's all good

18871,/bob-dylan/,"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)","Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying.

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying.

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying.

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred.

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much
Is really sacred.

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have
To stand naked.

An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you.

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks
They really found you.

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forgit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to.

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate what they do to be
Nothing more than something
They invest in.

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him.

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in.

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares Propaganda, all is phony.

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes
Must get lonely.

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me?

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only."
18872,/bob-dylan/,Jack-A-Roe,"Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell.
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.

She had sweethearts a-plenty and men of high degree.
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Oh, her true love e'er to be.

""Oh daughter, oh daughter, your body I will confine.
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Oh, would ever suit your mind.

""This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Oh, would have this heart of mine.

Now Jackie's gone sailing with trouble on his mind.
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Oh, his darling girl behind.

She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Oh, convey herself away.

""Before you step onboard, sir, your name I'd like to know.""
She smiled all in her countenance, said, ""They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe.""

""Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Oh, to face the cannonball.

""I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small,
But they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Oh, to see ten thousand fall.""

The war soon being over, they hunted all around.
Among the dead and dying her darling love she found,
Oh, her darling love she found.

She picked him up all in her arms and carries him to town,
And sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds.

This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
This couple they got married, so why not you and me,
Oh, so why not you and me.

18874,/bob-dylan/,Jim Jones,"1. Come and listen for a moment, lads,
And hear me tell my tale.
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail.
Now the jury found me guilty,
Then says the judge, says he,
""Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea.
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang.
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay,
Or else you'll surely hang.
Or else you'll surely hang,"" says he.
""And after that, Jim Jones,
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones.""

2. And our ship was high upon the sea
Then pirates came along,
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong.
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Tan gone to Botany Bay.
With the storms ragin' round us,
And the winds a-blowin' gale,
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales.

3. Now it's day and night and the irons clang,
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves,
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains,
Well, into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bravest rankers there,
Jack Donohue and co.
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all,
I'll gun the flogger down.
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock,
Remember what I say,
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay.

18875,/bob-dylan/,Joey,"Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, ""Well,"" he answered, ""just
because.""

Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last.
They called Joe ""Crazy,"" the baby they called ""Kid Blast.""
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?

There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof.

The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners.
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs.

The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim,
""Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame.""
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, ""We're not those kind of men.
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again.""

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?

The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with.
""What time is it?"" said the judge to Joey when they met
""Five to ten,"" said Joey. The judge says, ""That's exactly what you get.""

He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike.
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.

When they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, ""I have returned and now I want what's mine.""

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
Why did they have to come and blow you away?

It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
""I'm around too many children,"" he'd say, ""they should never know of one.""
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe,
Emptied out the register, said, ""Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe.""

One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork.
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?

Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep.
I heard his best friend Frankie say, ""He ain't dead, he's just asleep.""
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.

The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?

18876,/bob-dylan/,John Brown,"John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore.
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all.
His mama's face broke out all in a grin.

""Oh son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son
of mine,
You make me proud to know you hold a gun.
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get,
And we'll put them on the wall when you come home.""

As that old train pulled out, John's ma began to
shout,
Tellin' ev'ryone in the neighborhood:
""That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier
now, you know.""
She made well sure her neighbors understood.

She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door.
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and
gun,
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war.

Oh! Good old-fashioned war!

Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come.
They ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Then a letter finally came saying, ""Go down and
meet the train.
Your son's a-coming home from the war.""

She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight.
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last,
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes.

Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not
know,
While she couldn't even recognize his face!

Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face.

""Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what
they done.
How is it you come to be this way?""
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away.

""Don't you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home... acting proud.
You wasn't there standing in my shoes.""

""Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am
I doing here?
I'm a-tryin' to kill somebody or die tryin'.
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine.""

Oh! Lord! Just like mine!

""And I couldn't help but think, through the
thunder rolling and stink,
That I was just a puppet in a play.
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke,
And a cannon ball blew my eyes away.""

As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seein' the metal brace that helped him stand.
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand."
18877,/bob-dylan/,John Wesley Harding,"John Wesley Harding
Was a friend to the poor,
He trav'led with a gun in ev'ry hand.
All along this countryside,
He opened a many a door,
But he was never known
To hurt a honest man.

'Twas down in Chaynee County,
A time they talk about,
With his lady by his side
He took a stand.
And soon the situation there
Was all but straightened out,
For he was always known
To lend a helping hand.

All across the telegraph
His name it did resound,
But no charge held against him
Could they prove.
And there was no man around
Who could track or chain him down,
He was never known
To make a foolish move.

You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same

Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost

But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough

How much longer will you be gone?
Oh, Katie, won't ya tell me straight:
How much longer do I have to wait?

I'll believe you,
But please come through.
I know it's wrong to be apart this long;
You should be here, near me.

Katie's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind.
She's gone to find some newer places,
Left the old life far behind.
Dear Katie, dont ya miss your home?
I dont see why you had to roam.

âªI'm searching for love, for inspiration â¬
âªOn that pirate radio station
âªComing out of Luxembourg and Budapest â¬
âªRadio signal, clear as can be
âªI'm so deep in love that I can hardly see â¬
âªDown on the flatlands, way down in Key West

âªKey West is the place to be â¬
âªIf you're looking for immortality â¬
âªStay on the road, follow the highway sign â¬
âªKey West is fine and fair
âªIf you lost your mind, you will find it there
âªKey West is on the horizon line

âªI was born on the wrong side of the railroad track
âªLike Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac
âªLike Louis and Jimmy and Buddy and all the rest â¬
âªWell, it might not be the thing to do â¬
âªBut I'm sticking with you through and through â¬
âªDown in the flatlands, way down in Key West
âªI got both my feet planted square on the ground â¬
âªGot my right hand high with the thumb down â¬
âªSuch is life, such is happiness
âªHibiscus flowers, they grow everywhere here
âªIf you wear one, put it behind your ear
âªDown in the bottom, way down in Key West â¬

âªKey West is the place to go
âªDown by the Gulf of Mexico â¬
âªBeyond the sea, beyond the shifting sand
âªKey West is the gateway key â¬
âªTo innocence and purity â¬
âªKey West, Key West is the enchanted land

âªI've never lived in the land of Oz â¬
âªOr wasted my time with an unworthy cause â¬
âªIt's hot down here, and you can't be overdressed
âªChina blossoms of a toxic plant â¬
âªThey can make you dizzy
I'd like to help you but I can't
âªDown in the flatlands, way down in Key West â¬
âªWell, the fish tail ponds, and the orchid trees
âªThey can give you that bleeding heart disease
âªPeople tell me
I ought to try a little tenderness â¬
âªOn Newton Street, Bayview Park â¬
âªWalking in the shadows after dark â¬
âªDown under, way down in Key West â¬
âªI played Gumbo Limbo spirituals
âªI know all the Hindu rituals â¬
âªPeople tell me that I'm truly blessed â¬
Bougainvillea blooming in the summer, in the spring
Winter here is an unknown thing
Down in the flat lands, way down in Key West

Key West is under the sun, under the radar, under the gun
You stay to the left, and then you lean to the right
Feel the sunlight on your skin
and the healing virtues of the wind
Key West, Key West is the land of light

Wherever I travel, wherever I roam
I'm not that far before I come back home
I do what I think is right, what I think is best
History Street off of Mallory Square
Truman had his White House there
East bound, West bound, way down in Key West
Twelve years old, they put me in a suit
Forced me to marry a prostitute
There were gold fringes on her wedding dress
That's my story, but not where it ends
She's still cute, and we're still friends
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West
I play both sides against the middle
Trying to pick up that pirate radio signal
I heard the news, I heard your last request
Fly around, my pretty little Miss
I don't love nobody, give me a kiss
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West

Key West is the place to be
If you're looking for immortality
Key West is paradise divine
Key West is fine and fair
If you lost your mind, you'll find it there
Key West is on the horizon line"
18884,/bob-dylan/,Kingsport Town,"The winter wind is a blowing strong
My hands have got no gloves
I wish to my soul that I could see
The girl I'm a-thinking of

Don't you remember me babe
I remember you quite well
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town
With a high sheriff on my trail

High sheriff on my trail, boys
High sheriff on my trail
All because I'm falling for
A curly-headed dark-eyed girl

Who's a-gonna stroke your cold black hair
And sandy colored skin
Who's a-gonna kiss your Menphis lips
When I'm out in the wind
When I'm out in the wind, babe
When I'm out in the wind
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth
When I'm out in the wind

Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
And tell you everything's alright
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long
And not just in the night
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
Who's a-gonna be your man
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye
And hold your bad luck hand

Hold your bad luck hand, babe
Hold your bad luck hand
Who's a-gonna hold your hard luck hand
And who's a-gonna be your man

The winter wind is a blowing strong
My hands have got no gloves
I wish to my soul I could see
The girl I'm a-thinking of.

18885,/bob-dylan/,Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie,"When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
If the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
And to yourself you sometimes say
""I never knew it was gonna be this way
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born""
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
And you need it badly but it lays on the street
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
And you think yer ears might a been hurt
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush
And all the time you were holdin' three queens
And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean
Like in the middle of Life magazine
Bouncin' around a pinball machine
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed
And no matter how you try you just can't say it
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
And his jaws start closin with you underneath
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
And you say to yourself just what am I doin'
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
On this curve I'm hanging
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
In this air I'm inhaling
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
Why am I walking, where am I running
What am I saying, what am I knowing
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'
In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'
In the words that I'm thinkin'
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
Who am I helping, what am I breaking
What am I giving, what am I taking
But you try with your whole soul best
Never to think these thoughts and never to let
Them kind of thoughts gain ground
Or make yer heart pound
But then again you know why they're around
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
""Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
If that was you in the dream that was screaming
And you know that it's something special you're needin'
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
And you need something special
Yeah, you need something special all right
You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
That won't laugh at yer looks
Your voice or your face
And by any number of bets in the book
Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze
You need something to open up a new door
To show you something you seen before
But overlooked a hundred times or more
You need something to open your eyes
You need something to make it known
That it's you and no one else that owns
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
That the world ain't got you beat
That it ain't got you licked
It can't get you crazy no matter how many
Times you might get kicked
You need something special all right
You need something special to give you hope
But hope's just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve

But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
And yer trouble is you know it too good
""Cause you look an' you start getting the chills

""Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
And it ain't on Macy's window sill
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
And it ain't on that dimlit stage
With that half-wit comedian on it
Ranting and raving and taking yer money
And you thinks it's funny
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
And sure as hell you're bound to tell
That no matter how hard you rub
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
Or down any movie star's blouse
And you can't find it on the golf course
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
When you can't even sense if they got any insides
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
No you'll not now or no other day
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache?BR> And inside it the people made of molasses
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
And before you can count from one to ten
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
My friend
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
And play games with each other in their sand-box world
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
That run around gallant
And make all rules for the ones that got talent
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And think they're foolin' you
The ones who jump on the wagon
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
To get their kicks, get out of it quick
And make all kinds of rnoney and chicks
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
Sayin', ""Christ do I gotta be like that
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
Good God Almighty
THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL""

No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
You gotta look some other place
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
And out there somewhere
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
You can touch and twist
And turn two kinds of doorknobs
You can either go to the church of your choice
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
You'll find God in the church of your choice
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital

And though it's only my opinion
I may be right or wrong
You'll find them both
In the Grand Canyon
At sundown

18886,/bob-dylan/,Lay Down Your Weary Tune,"Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
Lay down the song you strum,
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum.

Struck by the sounds before the sun,
I knew the night had gone.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew
Against the drums of dawn.
Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
Lay down the song you strum,
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum.

The ocean wild like an organ played,
The seaweed's wove its strands.
The crashin' waves like cymbals clashed
Against the rocks and sands.
Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
Lay down the song you strum,
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum.

I stood unwound beneath the skies
And clouds unbound by laws.
The cryin' rain like a trumpet sang
And asked for no applause.
Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
Lay down the song you strum,
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum.

The last of leaves fell from the trees
And clung to a new love's breast.
The branches bare like a banjo played
To the winds that listened best.

I gazed down in the river's mirror
And watched its winding strum.
The water smooth ran like a hymn
And like a harp did hum.
Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
Lay down the song you strum,
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum.

18887,/bob-dylan/,Lenny Bruce,"Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon.
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit's livin' on and on.

Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin'
about. Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies' heads,
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.

Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn't commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
I rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half,
Seemed like it took a couple of months.
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone.

They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.

tough times that they never shared
They've had nothing to say to us before

All we need is honesty
A little humility and trust

I know we're not perfect

As if there just ain't no other way

The friend you used to be, so near and dear to me
You slipped so far away, where did we go astray
I passed the old school yard, admitting life is hard
Without you near me

Ever since the day, the day you went away
I felt that emptiness so wide
I don't know what's wrong or right
I just know I need strength to fight, strength to fight that world outside

Since we've been out of touch I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day my heart stays locked away
I walk the boulevard, admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The Sun is sinking low I guess it's time to go
I feel a chilly breeze In place of memories
My dreams are locked and barred admitting life is hard
Without you near me

18894,/bob-dylan/,Lily of the West,"When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west.

I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find
But she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest
Then go, my lovely Flora, the lily of the west.

Away down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
Conversin' with my Flora there, it seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west.

I stepped up my rival, dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar, and bodly made him stand
Seing mad by desperation I pierced him to the breast
All this for lovely Flora, the lily of the west.

I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the west."
18895,/bob-dylan/,"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts","The festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall.
The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down,
Anyone with any sense had already left town.
He was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts.

He moved across the mirrored room,
""Set it up for everyone"" he said,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their
heads. Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
""Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?""
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts.

Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs,
Lily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair.
Outside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide,
A gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside.
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.

Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
He made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine.
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.

Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown.
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
""Sorry, darlin', that I'm late"" but he didn't seem to hear.
He was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts.

""I know I've seen that face before""; Big Jim was thinkin' to himself,
""Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf""
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet
And the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Starin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.

Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
She did whatever she had to do,
she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
She'd come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.

The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
The drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king.
No, nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.

Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife,
She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife.
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died.
She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts.

Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away.
""Has your luck run out"" she laughed at him,
""Well, I guess you must
have known it would someday.
Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint,
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint""
Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts.

The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair.
""There's something funny going on,"" he said
""I can just feel it in the air""
He went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk,
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk.
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.

Lily's arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch,
She forgot all about the man she couldn't stand
Who hounded her so much.
""I've missed you so""; she said to him, and he felt she was sincere,
But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear.
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts.

No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick,
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked.
And Big Jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised,
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes.
She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts.

Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe,
it's said that they got off with quite a haul.
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town.
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts.

The next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back.
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
The hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink.
The only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts.

The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, ""Closed for repair""
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
She was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Thinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law.
But, most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts."
18896,/bob-dylan/,Little Maggie,"1. Oh, where is little Maggie
Over yonder she stands,
Rifle on her shoulder,
Six-shooter in her hand.

2. How can I ever stand it,
Just to see them two blue eyes,
Shinin' like some diamonds,
Like some diamonds in the sky.

3. Rather be in some lonely hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine,
Than to see you be another man's darling,
And to know that you'll never be mine.

4. Well, it's march me away to the station
With my suitcase in my hand,
Yes, march me away to the station,
I'm off to some far-distant land.

5. Sometimes I have a nickel,
And sometimes I have a dime,
Sometimes I have ten dollars,
Just to pay for little Maggie's wine.

6. Pretty flowers are made for blooming,
Pretty stars are made to shine,
Pretty girls are made for boy's love,
Little Maggie was made for mine.

7. Well, yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hand,
She's a drinkin' down her troubles
Over courtin' some other man.

18897,/bob-dylan/,Little Sadie,"Went out last night to take a little round.
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head.

I began to think what a deed I'd done,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run.
I made a god run but I ran too slow;
They overtook me down in Jericho

Standing on a corner ringin' my bell,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
He said ""Young man is you name Brown?
Remember the night you blowed Little Sadie down.""

""Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee.
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.
First degree and second degree,
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?""

Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black.
They put me on a train and they brought me back.
I had no one for to go my bail;
They crammed me back into the county jail.

The judge and the jury they took their stand.
The judge had the papers in his right hand.
Forty-one days, forty-one nights;
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.

18898,/bob-dylan/,Living the Blues,"Since you've been gone,
I've been walking around
With my head bowed down to my shoes.
I've been living the blues
Ev'ry night without you.

I don't have to go far
To know where you are,
Strangers all give me the news.
I've been living the blues
Ev'ry night without you.

I think that it's best,
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride.
But I can't deny
This feeling that I
Carry for you deep down inside.

If you see me this way,
You'd come back and you'd stay,
Oh, how could you refuse.
I've been living the blues
Ev'ry night without you.

18899,/bob-dylan/,Lo and Behold!,"I pulled out for San Anton',
I never felt so good.
My woman said she'd meet me there
And of course, I knew she would.
The coachman, he hit me for my hook
And he asked me my name.
I give it to him right away,
Then I hung my head in shame.
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

I come into Pittsburgh
At six-thirty flat.
I found myself a vacant seat
An' I put down my hat.
""What's the matter, Molly, dear,
What's the matter with your mound?""
""What's it to ya, Moby Dick?
This is chicken town!""
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

I bought my girl
A herd of moose,
One she could call her own.
Well, she came out the very next day
To see where they had flown.
I'm goin' down to Tennessee,
Get me a truck 'r somethin'.
Gonna save my money and rip it up!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

Now, I come in on a ferris wheel
An' boys, I sure was slick.
I come in like a ton of bricks,
Laid a few tricks on 'em.
Goin' back to Pittsburgh,
Count up to thirty,
Round that horn and ride that herd,
Gonna thread up!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

18900,/bob-dylan/,Lone Pilgrim,"1. I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay,
And patiently stood by his tomb,
When in a low whisper I heard something say:
How sweetly I sleep here alone.

2. The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
The tears are all wiped from my eyes.

3. The call of my master compelled me from home,
No kindred or relative nigh.
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
My soul flew to mansions on high.

4. Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Has kindly assisted me home.

Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor
When I left my longtime darling, she was standing in the door

Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war

My sister she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore

Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months

Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once

Well the road washed out, weather not fit for man or beast
Well the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast
Funny, the things you have the hardest time parting with, are the things you need the least

Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive
Set my dial on the radio I wish my mother was still alive

I seen your lover-man comin', comin' across the barren fields
I see your lover-man comin', comin' 'cross the barren fields
He not a gentleman at all, he's rotten to the core, he's a coward and he steals

Well my captain he's decorated, he's well-schooled and he's skilled
My captain he's decorated, he's well-schooled and he's skilled
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all; how many of his pals have been killed.

Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was
Last night the wind was whispering something, I was trying to make out what it was
Yeah I tell myself something's coming, but it never does

I'm going to spare the defeated, I'm going to speak to the crowd
I'm going to spare the defeated, 'cause I'm going to speak to the crowd
I'm going to teach peace to the conquered, I'm going to tame the proud

18902,/bob-dylan/,Long and Wasted Years,"It's been such a long, long time
Since we loved each other and our hearts were true
One time, for one brief day, I was the man for you

Last night I heard you talking in your sleep
Saying things you shouldn't say
Oh baby, you just might have to go to jail someday

Is there a place we can go?
Is there anybody we can see?
Maybe, it's the same for you as it is for me

I ain't seen my family in twenty- years
That ain't easy to understand
They may be dead by now
I lost track of them after they lost their land

Shake it up baby twist and shout
You know what it's all about
What you doing out there in the sun anyway
Don't you know the sun can burn your brains right out

My enemy crashed into the dust
Stopped in dead his tracks and he lost his lust
He was run down hard and he broke apart
He died in shame he had a iron heart

I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes
There are secrets in them I cant disguise
Come back baby if I ever hurt your feelings I apologize

Two trains running by side side
Forty miles wide, down the eastern line
You don't have to go I just came to you cause your a friend of mine

I think that when my back was turned
The whole world behind me burned
It's been awhile since we walked down that long, long isle

We cried on that cold and frosty morn
We cried because our souls were torn
So much for tears, so much for these long and wasted years"

There are thousands in the phone booth,
Thousands at the gate.

18904,/bob-dylan/,Lord Protect My Child,"For his age, he's wise
He's got his mother's eyes
There's gladness in his heart
He's young and he's wild
My only prayer is, if I can't be there,
Lord, protect my child

As his youth now unfolds
He is centuries old
Just to see him at play makes me smile
No matter what happens to me
No matter what my destiny
Lord, protect my child

While the world is asleep
You can look at it and weep
Few things you find are worthwhile
And though I don't ask for much
No material things to touch
Lord, protect my child

He's young and on fire
Full of hope and desire
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled
If I fall along the way
And can't see another day
Lord, protect my child

There'll be a time I hear tell
When all will be well
When God and man will be reconciled
But until men lose their chains
And righteousness reigns
Lord, protect my child

18905,/bob-dylan/,Love Henry,"1. ""Get down, get down, Love Henry,"" she cried.
""And stay all night with me.
I have gold chains, and the finest I have
I'll apply them all to thee.""

2. ""I can't get down and I shan't get down,
Or stay all night with thee.
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
I love far better than thee.""

3. He layed his head on a pillow of down.
Kisses she gave him three.
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
She murdered mortal he.

Instrumental

4. ""Get well, get well, Love Henry, "" She cried,
""Get well, get well,"" said she.
""Oh don't you see my own heart's blood
Come flowin' down so free?""

5. She took him by his long yellow hair,
And also by his feet.
She plunged him into well water, where
It runs both cold and deep.

6. ""Lie there, lie there, Love Henry,"" she cried,
""Til the flesh rots off your bones.
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
Will mourn for your return.""

7. ""Hush up, hush up, my parrot,"" she cried,
""And light on my right knee.
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And hung on a willow tree.""

And light on your right knee.
A girl who would murder her own true love
Would kill a little birdlike me.""
"
18906,/bob-dylan/,Love Minus Zero/No Limit,"My love she speaks like silence,
Without ideals or violence,
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire.
People carry roses,
Make promises by the hours,
My love she laughs like the flowers,
Valentines can't buy her.

In the dime stores and bus stations,
People talk of situations,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Some speak of the future,
My love she speaks softly,
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all.

The cloak and dagger dangles,
Madams light the candles.
In ceremonies of the horsemen,
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Statues made of match sticks,
Crumble into one another,
My love winks, she does not bother,
She knows too much to argue or to judge.

The bridge at midnight trembles,
The country doctor rambles,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
The wind howls like a hammer,
The night blows cold and rainy,
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing.
"
18907,/bob-dylan/,Love Sick,"I'm walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

I'm sick of love but I'm in the thick of it
This kind of love I'm so sick of it

I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them 'til they're gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

I'm sick of love; I hear the clock tick
This kind of love; I'm love sick

Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder
Could you ever be true?
I think of you
And I wonder

I'm sick of love; I wish I'd never met you
I'm sick of love; I'm trying to forget you

Just don't know what to do
I'd give anything to
Be with you

It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.

He hands you a dime,
He asks you with a grin
If you're havin' a good time,
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks.
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks.
The National Guard stands around his door.
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law.
Everybody says
She's the brains behind pa.
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am,
But everybody wants you
To be just like them.

Even though my mind is hazy an' my thoughts they might be narrow,
Where you been don't bother me nor bring me down in sorrow.
It don't even mind where you're wakin' up tomorrow,
But mama, you're just on my mind.

I am not askin' you to say words like ""yes"" or ""no""
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go.
I'm just whisperin' to myself, so I can pretend that I don't know,
Mama, you been on my mind.

When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your mirror.
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near.
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind."

In the long black coat.

Somebody seen him hanging around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town,
He looked into her eyes when she stopped to ask
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote
There was dust on the man
In the long black coat.

Preacher was a talkin' there's a sermon he gave,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
She gave her heart to the man

There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way.
Bridge: But people don't live or die, people just float.

I'll see you on Gods golden shore.

Through this open world I'm a-bound to ramble,
Through ice and snows, sleet and rain,
I'm a-bound to ride that mornin' railroad,

In an old wooden chair

Would look for me there
Sorrow and pity
Rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothing
Anyone's eyes

Once I had pretty girls
Did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Snowflakes are falling
Around my head
Lord have mercy

It feel heavy like lead
I been hit too hard
Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city

And the road ain't long
Loneliness
Got a mind of its own
The more people around
The more you feel alone
I'm chained to the earth
Like a silent slave
Trying to break free

Out of death's dark cave
Once I had a pretty girl
Done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Boys in the street
Beginning to play
Girls like birds

Flying away
I'm carrying the roses
That were given to me
And I'm thinking about paradise
Wondering what it might be
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Go over to london
Maybe gay paree
Follow the river
You get to the sea
I was hoping we could drink from
Life's clear streams
I was hoping we could dream
Life's pleasant dreams
Once I had a pretty girl
But she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city

And the road ain't long
Well the weak get weaker
And the strong stay strong
The train keeps rolling
All night long
She looked at me
With an irresistable glance
With a smile

That could make all the planets dance
Once I had a pretty girl
She did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
My house is on fire
Burning to the skies
I thought the rain clouds
But the clouds passed by

When I'm gone
You'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame
Once I had a pretty girl
But she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

The colours fine and the bands did play
And it caused young mary for to say
""I'll wed you me gallant soldier""

She viewed the soldiers on parade
And as they stood at their leisure
And mary to herself did say: ""at last I find my treasure
But oh how cruel my parents must be
To banish my true love away from me
Well I'll leave them all and I'll go with thee
Me bold and undaunted soldier""

""Oh mary dear, your parents'
Love I pray don't be unruly
For when you're in a foreign land
Believe you rue it surely
Perhaps in battle I might fall
From a shot from an angry cannonball
And you're so far from your daddy's hall
Be advised by a gallant soldier. ""

""Oh I have fifty guineas in right gold
Likewise a hearth that's burning
And I'd leave them all and I'd go with
You me bold undaunted soldier
So don't say no but let me go
And I will face the daring foe
And we'll march together to and fro
And I'll wed you, my gallant soldier""

And when he saw her loyalty
And mary so true-hearted
He said: ""me darling, married
We'll be and nothing but death will part us
And when we're in a foreign land
I'll guard you, darling, with my right hand
And hopes that God might stand a friend
With mary and her gallant soldier"""

The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.

Ten thousand miles away from home, ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I never nomore return to you, Mary Ann.

Oh, don't you see that crow fly high, she'll surely turn to white
If never I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear, Mary Ann.

If I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And a great big bowl for two to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann

18918,/bob-dylan/,Maybe Someday,"Maybe someday you'll be satisfied
When you've lost everything you'll have nothing left to hide.
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Maybe you'll beg me to take you back.
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Maybe then you'll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool.
Maybe someday when you're by yourself alone
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.

Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned.
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Maybe someday, you will understand
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.

Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt.
When both of us, baby, were going though some sort of a test
Neither one of us could do what we do best.
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Maybe someday, you'll believe me when I say
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.

Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high
Sayin' ""For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?""
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do
For not breakin' down no bedroom door to get at you.
Always was a sucker for the right cross.
Never wanted to go home 'til the last cent was lost.
Maybe someday you will look back and see
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.

Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell.
I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
You said you were going' to Frisco, stay a couple of months.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true
There was no greater love than what I had for you.

18919,/bob-dylan/,Maybe You'll Be There,"Each time I see a crowd of people
Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do
But maybe you'll be there

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms
would always hold me
You said you lips
were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this

Someday if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart
I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll
Be there"

Forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night
Forever taunts me

Stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood

Gone is every joy and inspiration
Tears are all I have to show
No consolation
All I can see is grief and gloom
Till the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood

Deep in the night
I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss
A warm embrace
But love is a whimsy
And as flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace
An empty space

Melancholy mood, why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains
The chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free
Bring her back to me
Oh, melancholy mood"

I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie; that's all right mama, I told myself one too

You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you; I didn't tell them everything I knew
Well I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you

I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you

I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what it's all coming to
Well I'm tryin' to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you

Well I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don't know who
Well, I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

The last thing you said before you hit the street
""Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet""

And now he's stuck on top of the hill.
With twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb,

Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling up, we struggle and we stray
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape

City's just a jungle, more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

Got nothing for you, I had nothing before
Don't even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, Pain pouring down
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around

All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking about the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed

Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind

Well I got here following the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for all those who sailed with me

Everybody's moving, if they ain't already there
Everybody's got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long"

An' I'm lookin' for a woman
Whose head's mixed up like mine

18927,/bob-dylan/,Moonlight,"Words and music by Bob Dylan

The seasons they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
To hear again the songbird's sweet melodious tone
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

The dusky light the day is losing
Orchids, poppies, black eyed susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony
The blessings of tranquility
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
I take you 'cross the river, dear
You've no need to linger here
I know the kinds of things you like

The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees
The petals pink and white, the wind has blown
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

The trailing moss in mystic glow, the purple blossom soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea
Doctor, lawyer, indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love?
It tolls for you and me

Old pulse's running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that grow
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

For seventeen long years,
I've spent all my money,
On whiskey and beer,
I go to some hollow,
And sit at my still
And if whiskey dont kill me,
Then I dont know what will,

I go to some bar room,
And drink with my friends,
Where the women cant follow,
And see what I spend,
God bless them pretty women,
I wish they was mine,
Their breath is as sweet,
The dew on the vine,

Let me eat when I am hungry,
Let me drink when I am dry,
A dollar when I am hard up,
Religion when I die,
The whole world's a bottle,
And life's but a dram,
When the bottle gets empty,
It sure aint worth a damn.

Stay right with it, when the road unwinds,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I don't even notice she's gone,
Most of the time.

Most of the time
It's well understood,
Most of the time
I wouldn't change it if I could,
I can't make it all match up, I can hold my own,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I can survive, I can endure
And I don't even think about her
Most of the time.

Most of the time
My head is on straight,
Most of the time
I'm strong enough not to hate.
I don't build up illusion 'till it makes me sick,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind.
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time.

Most of the time
She ain't even in my mind,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her
She's that far behind.
Most of the time
I can't even be sure
If she was ever with me
Or if I was with her.

Most of the time
I'm halfway content,
Most of the time
I know exactly where I went,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Hide from the feelings, that are buried inside,
I don't compromised and I don't pretend,
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time.

18931,/bob-dylan/,Motorpsycho Nightmare,"I pounded on a farmhouse
Lookin' for a place to stay.
I was mighty, mighty tired,
I had gone a long, long way.
I said, ""Hey, hey, in there,
Is there anybody home?""
I was standin' on the steps
Feelin' most alone.
Well, out comes a farmer,
He must have thought that I was nuts.
He immediately looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts.

I fell down
To my bended knees,
Saying, ""I dig farmers,
Don't shoot me, please!""
He cocked his rifle
And began to shout,
""You're that travelin' salesman
That I have heard about.""
I said, ""No! No! No!
I'm a doctor and it's true,
I'm a clean-cut kid
And I been to college, too.""

Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita.
She looked like she stepped out of
La Dolce Vita.
I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad,
And told him what a
Nice, pretty farm he had.
He said, ""What do doctors
Know about farms, pray tell?""
I said, ""I was born
At the bottom of a wishing well.""

Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
""I guess you're tired,""
He said, kinda sly.
I said, ""Yes, ten thousand miles
Today I drove.""
He said, ""I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove.
Just one condition
And you go to sleep right now,
That you don't touch my daughter
And in the morning, milk the cow.""

I was sleepin' like a rat
When I heard something jerkin'.
There stood Rita
Lookin' just like Tony Perkins.
She said, ""Would you like to take a shower?
I'll show you up to the door.""
I said, ""Oh, no! no!
I've been through this before.""
I knew I had to split
But I didn't know how,
When she said,
""Would you like to take that shower, now?""

Well, I couldn't leave
Unless the old man chased me out,
'Cause I'd already promised
That I'd milk his cows.
I had to say something
To strike him very weird,
So I yelled out,
""I like Fidel Castro and his beard.""
Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way,
As he came charging down the stairs
Sayin', ""What's that I heard you say?""

I said, ""I like Fidel Castro,
I think you heard me right,""
And ducked as he swung
At me with all his might.
Rita mumbled something
'Bout her mother on the hill,
As his fist hit the icebox,
He said he's going to kill me
If I don't get out the door
In two seconds flat,
""You unpatriotic, Rotten doctor Commie rat.""

Well, he threw a Reader's Digest
At my head and I did run,
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour,
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers.
Rita said, ""Come back!""
As he started to load
The sun was comin' up
And I was runnin' down the road.

Well, I don't figure I'll be back
There for a spell,
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job in a motel.
He still waits for me,
Constant, on the sly.
He wants to turn me in
To the F.B.I.
Me, I romp and stomp,
Thankful as I romp,
Without freedom of speech,
I might be in the swamp.

The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek.
It's very nice to stay a week or two.
And maybe fall in love just me and you.

There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance.

Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land.

And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it's so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique."

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh he jumped so high and he
clicked up his heels
He let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance.

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughtout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him just travelled about
Hid dog up and died, he up and died, and after 20 years he still grieves
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.

He said ""I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips

""Of course we do, we know who you are""

Shot down like a dog in broad daylight
Was a matter of timing and the timing was right
You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
We'll mock you and shock you and we'll put it in your face
We've already got someone here to take your place
The day they blew out the brains of the king
Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
Right there in front of everyone's eyes
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun
Perfectly executed, skillfully done
Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl

Hush, little children, you'll understand
The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
Slide down the banister, go get your coat

Better not show your faces after the sun goes down
Up in the red light district, they've got cop on the beat
Living in a nightmare on Elm Street
When you're down on Deep Ellum
put your money in your shoe
Don't ask what your country can do for you
Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn

The place where faith, hope, and charity died
Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
See if you can shoot the invisible man
Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye, Uncle Sam
Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn
What is the truth, and where did it go?
Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know

Ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
Headed straight on in to the afterlife

Hold on, I've been led into some kind of a trap
Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
We're right down the street, from the street where you live
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain
What more could they do? They piled on the pain
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by

Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive
Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials

18936,/bob-dylan/,My Back Pages,"Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
'm younger than that now.

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
""Equality,"" I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now."
18937,/bob-dylan/,My Own Version Of You,"All through the summers, into January
I've been visiting mosques and monasteries
Looking for the necessary body parts
Limbs and livers and brains and hearts
I'll bring someone to life, is what I wanna do
I'm gonna create my own version of you

Well, it must be the winter of my discontent
I wish you'd've taken me with you
wherever you went
They talk all night and they talk all day
But not for a minute
do I believe anything they say
I'm gon' bring someone to life, someone I've never seen
You know what I mean
you know exactly what I mean

I'll take the scar-faced Pacino
and the Godfather vandal
Mix it up and attack, and get a robot commander
If I do it all right and put the head on straight
I'll be saved by the creature that I create
I'll get blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice
I don't gamble with cards and I don't shoot no dice
Can you look in my face with your sightless eyes?
Can you cross your heart and hope to die?
I'll bring someone to life, someone for real
Someone who feels the way that I feel

I study Sanskrit and Arabic to improve my mind
I wanna do things for the benefit of all my my kind
I say to the willow tree, ""Don't wait for me""
I'm saying the hell with all things that used to be
Well, I'm get into trouble, then I hit the wall
No place to turn, no place at all
I'll pick a number between a-one and two
And I ask myself, ""What would Julius Caesar do? ""
I'll bring someone to life in more ways than one
Don't matter how long it takes, it'll be done when it's done

I'm gon' make you play the piano like Leon Russell
Like Liberace, like St. John the Apostle
I'll play every number that I can play
I'll see you maybe on Judgment Day
After midnight, if you still wanna meet
I'll be in Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street
Two doors down, not that far a walk
I'll hear your footsteps, you won't have to knock
I'll bring someone to life, balance the scales
I'm not gonna get involved in any insignificant details

You can bring it to St. Peter
You can bring it to Jerome
You can bring it all the way over
Bring it all the way home
Bring it to the corner where the children play
You can bring it to me on a silver tray
I'll bring someone to life, spare no expense
Do it with decency and common sense

Can you tell me what it means, to be or not to be?
You won't get away with fooling me
Can you help me walk that good land mile?
Can you give me the blessings of your smile?
I'll bring someone to life, use all of my powers
Do it in the dark in the wee, small hours

I can see the history of the whole human race
It's all right there, it's carved into your face
Should I break it all down? Should I fall on my knees?
Is there light at the end of the tunnel
can you tell me please?
Stand over there by the cypress tree
Where the Trojan women and children
were sold into slavery
Long before the first Crusade
Way back before England or America were made
Step right into the burning hell
Where some of the best-known enemies of mankind dwell
Mr. Freud with his dreams, Mr. Marx with his ax
See the raw hide lash rip the skin from their backs
Got the right spirit, you can feel it you can hear it
You've got what they call the immortal spirit
You can feel it all night, you can feel it in the morn
It creeps in your body, the day you were born
One strike of lightning is all that I need
And a blast of electricity
that runs at top speed
Shimmy your ribs, I'll stick in the knife
Gonna jump-start my creation to life
I wanna bring someone to life, turn back the years
Do it with laughter and do it with tears"

Well there's reasons for that and reasons for this
I can't think of any just now, but I know they exist
I'm sitting in the sun 'til my skin turns brown
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town

She can make you steal, make you rob
Give you the hives, make you lose your job
Make things bad, she can make things worse
She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse

One of these days, I'll end up on the run
I'm pretty sure, she'll make me kill someone
I'm going inside, roll the shutters down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

Well there's plenty to remember, plenty to forget
I still can remember the day we met
I lost my reason long ago
My love for her is all I know

State gone broke, the county's dry
Don't be looking at me, with that evil eye
Keep on walking don't be hanging around

Nothing back there anyway, that I can call my own
Go back home, leave me alone
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Ever since the British, burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound, in the heart of town
I saw you drinking, from an empty cup
I saw you buried, and I saw you dug up
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Look down angel, from the skies
Help my, weary soul to rise
I kissed her cheek, I dragged your frown(?)
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now.
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

In the courtyard, of the golden sun
You stand and fight, or you break and run
You went and lost, your lovely head
For a drink of wine, and a crust of bread
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

We neutered(?) and we plundered, on distant shores
Why is my share, not equal to yours
Your father left you, your mother too
Even death has, washed it's hands of you
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

This is hard country, to stay alive in
Blades are everywhere, and they're breaking my skin
I'm armed to the hilt, and I'm struggling hard
You won't get out, of here unscarred.
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

You got too many lovers, waiting at the wall
About a thousand tons, I couldn't count them all
Yesterday, I could've thrown them all in the sea
Today, even one, may be too much for me
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Can't walk them baby, you could do no wrong
Put your arms around me, where they belong
I won't take you under, for the ghost to ride(?)
Lay my hands all over ya, tie you to my side
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

I've got a heavy stacked woman, with a smile on her face
And she has crowned, my soul with grace
Im still hurting from an arrow, that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head, and bury it between your breasts
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Been dark all night, but now it's dawn
The moving finger, is moving on
You can guard me, while I sleep
Piss away, the tears I weep
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

I love women, and she loves men
We've been to the west, and we going back again
I heard a voice, at the dusk of day
Saying, ""Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray.""
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday"

The truth is I might drown before I find it.

Need a woman, yes I do.
Someone who can see me as I am,
Somebody who just don't give a damn.
And I want you to be that woman every night,
Be that woman.

I've had my eyes on you baby for about five long years,
You probably don't know me at all, but I have seen your laughter and tears.
Now you don't frighten me, my heart is jumping
And you look like it wouldn't hurt you none to have a man who could give ya something.

Well I need a woman, oh don't I
Need a woman, bring it home safe at last.
Seen you turn the corner, seen your bootheels spark,
Seen you in the daylight, and watched you in the dark.
And I want you to be that woman, all right
Be that woman every night.

Well, if you believe in something long enough you just naturally come to think it's true.
There ain't no wall you can't cross over, ain't no fire you can't walk through.
Well, believing is all right, just don't let the wrong people know what it's all about.
They might put the evil eye on you, use their hidden powers to try to turn you out.

He's criticized and condemned for being alive.
He's not supposed to fight back, he's supposed to have thick skin,
He's supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.

That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him,
'Cause there's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac.

He got no allies to really speak of.
What he gets he must pay for, he don't get it out of love.
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.

Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease.
Now, they wouldn't hurt a fly.
To hurt one they would weep.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
He's the neighborhood bully.

Every empire that's enslaved him is gone,
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
He's the neighborhood bully.

Now his holiest books have been trampled upon,
No contract he signed was worth what it was written on.
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
He's the neighborhood bully.

What's anybody indebted to him for?
Nothin', they say.
He just likes to cause war.
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed,
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
He's the neighborhood bully.

What has he done to wear so many scars?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?

Running out the clock, time standing still,
Neighborhood bully.

18951,/bob-dylan/,No Time To Think,"In death, you face life with a child and a wife
Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls.
You're a soldier of mercy, you're cold and you curse,
""He who cannot be trusted must fall.""

Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety.
You fight for the throne and you travel alone
Unknown as you slowly sink
And there's no time to think.

In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity,
In secret, for pieces of change.
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
And it makes you feel violent and strange.

Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
In the valley of the missing link
And you have no time to think.

Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
Her worst is better than best.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
And I feel so depressed.

China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality.
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
And there's no time to think.

Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
Where the lion lies down with the lamb.
I'd have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
But that's just the way that I am.

Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality.
But the magician is quicker and his game
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And there's no time to think.

Anger and jealousy's all that he sells us,
He's content when you're under his thumb.
Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him
To survive it you play deaf and dumb.

Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity.
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear
At the back of your head as you drink
And there's no time to think.

Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
Will offer their heads for a prayer.
You can't find no salvation, you have no expectations
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere.

Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility.
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper
That is leading you onto the brink
But there's no time to think.

You've murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
For pleasure you must now resist.
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
They're not even sure you exist.

Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism.
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
And the sound of the keys as they clink
But there's no time to think.

The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
With the rose in her hair.
Starlight in the East and you're finally released
You're stranded but with nothing to share.

Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity.
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
'Neath the moon shinin' bloody and pink
And there's no time to think.

Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
But no, you will not be deceived.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt,
You can give but you cannot receive.

No time to choose when the truth must die,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there,
No time to suffer or blink
And no time to think.

Dance and sing and run when I was a child
Never seemed strange
But now I just pass mournfully by
That place where the bones of life are piled
I know somethin' has changed

18953,/bob-dylan/,North Country Blues,"Come gather 'round friends
And I'll tell you a tale
Of when the red iron pits ran plenty.
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.

In the north end of town,
My own children are grown
But I was raised on the other.
In the wee hours of youth,
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother.

The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door,
The drag lines an' the shovels they was a-humming.
'Til one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him.

Well a long winter's wait,
From the window I watched.
My friends they couldn't have been kinder.
And my schooling was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner.

Oh the years passed again
And the givin' was good,
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
What with three babies born,
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason.

Then the shaft was soon shut
And more work was cut,
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen.
'Til a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closin'.

They complained in the East,
They are paying too high.
They say that your ore ain't worth digging.
That it's much cheaper down
In the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothing.

So the mining gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinking.
Where the sad, silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.

I lived by the window
As he talked to himself,
This silence of tongues it was building.
Then one morning's wake,
The bed it was bare,
And I's left alone with three children.

The summer is gone,
The ground's turning cold,
The stores one by one they're a-foldin'.
My children will go
As soon as they grow.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.

18954,/bob-dylan/,Not Dark Yet,"Shadows are falling and I've been here all day
It's too hot to sleep time is running away
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal
There's not even room enough to be anywhere
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful face there's been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing what was in her mind
I just don't see why I should even care
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paree
I've followed the river and I got to the sea
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes
Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

I was born here and I'll die here against my will
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there."
18955,/bob-dylan/,Nothing was Delivered,"Nothing was delivered
And I tell this truth to you,
Not out of spite or anger
But simply because it's true.
Now, I hope you won't object to this,
Giving back all of what you owe,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
The sooner you can go.

Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.

Nothing was delivered
But I can't say I sympathize
With what your fate is going to be,
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Now you must provide some answers
For what you sell has not been received,
And the sooner you come up with them,
The sooner you can leave.

Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take heed of this and get plenty rest.

(Now you know)
Nothing was delivered
And it's up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made ev'rybody pay.
No, nothing was delivered,
Yes, 'n' someone must explain
That as long as it takes to do this
Then that's how long that you'll remain.

Nothing is better, nothing is best,

And the snow's so deep.
Build a fire, throw on logs
And listen to it hiss
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn

And keep me company,
There is plenty a room for all,
So please don't elbow me.

With each new tender kiss,

One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.

Only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
Leavin' nobody to carry him home
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
To look up on the world from a hole in the ground,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?

18971,/bob-dylan/,Only a Pawn in Their Game,"A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood.
A finger fired the trigger to his name.
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man's brain
But he can't be blamed
He's only a pawn in their game.

A South politician preaches to the poor white man,
""You got more than the blacks, don't complain.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin,"" they explain.
And the Negro's name
Is used it is plain
For the politician's gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And the marshals and cops get the same,
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
He's taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he's in
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks,
And the hoof beats pound in his brain.
And he's taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
They lowered him down as a king.
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
He'll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain:
Only a pawn in their game.

And it's been that way for a month or more
You've had things your way

You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?

And I can see it in your empty eyes
But there's no need for talking
Or walking round the block
Just to figure out the reason why

I have a hard time handing out warnings
I'll just slide on out the door

Nothing more wretched than what I must endure

I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake,
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

Night after night, Day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circlin' around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rising men
Just like you my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

Another politician pumping out the piss
another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
you got the same eyes that your mother does
if only you could prove who your father was
someone must of slipped a drug in yer wine
you gulped it down and you cross the line
man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

How I made it back home, nobody knows
or how I survived so many blows
I've been thru Hell, What good did it do?
You bastard!!! I'm suppose to respect you!!
I'll give you justice, I'll fattem your purse
Show me your moral that you reversed
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own.

You get your lover in the bed
Come here I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to raise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I play in blood, but not my own."

Says 'your wife', I say 'she's busy in the kitchen cookin''

Already told you, won't tell you again

I say 'how much you want for that, I'll go into the store'
Man says 'three dollars' 'all right', I say, 'will you take four?'
Po' boy, never say die
Things will be all right, by and by

Workin' like in a main line, workin' like the devil
The game is the same it's just upon another level
Po' boy, dressed in black
Police at your back

Po' boy in a red hot town
Out beyond the twinklin' stars
Ridin' first class train
Makin' the rounds
Try to keep from fallin' between the cars

Othello told Desdemona ""I'm cold, cover me with a blanket""
""By the way, what happened to that poisoned wine?""
She said ""I gave it to you, you drank it""

Pickin' up the cherries fallin' off the plate

Called down to room service, says 'send up a room'

My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him
When my mother died my uncle took me in to run a funeral parlor
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him

I don't know any more than this

Build you a house out of mortar and bricks

Knockin' on the door, I say 'who is it, where you from?'

Washin' them dishes, feedin' them swine

Love don't have any place.
We're living in times where men commit crimes
And crime don't have a face

We live in a political world,
Icicles hanging down,
Wedding bells ring and angels sing,
clouds cover up the ground.

We live in a political world,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell
Leaving no one to pick up a trail.

We live in a political world
Where mercy walks the plank,
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Up the steps into the nearest bank.

We live in a political world
Where courage is a thing of the past
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted
The next day could be your last.

We live in a political world.
The one we can see and can feel
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
We all know for sure that it's real.

We live in a political world
In the cities of lonesome fear,
Little by little you turn in the middle
But you're never why you're here.

We live in a political world
Under the microscope,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
You always got more than enough rope.

We live in a political world
Turning and a'thrashing about,
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
What looks like the easy way out.

We live in a political world
Where peace is not welcome at al,
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Or put up against the wall.

We live in apolitical world
Everything is hers or his,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name
But you're never sure what it is.

All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started, and was I the perplexed one
I held my breathe, and said ""May I have the next one""
In my frightened arms - polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions
in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions
but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage, built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning, of the words: ""ever after""

When I kiss the pug-nosed dream"

You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law.
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed

Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.

You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you touch up the night.
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed

18999,/bob-dylan/,"Rambling, Gambling Willie","Come around you rovin' gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
His name was Will O' Conley and he gambled all his life,
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife.
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
He had a reputation as the gamblin'est man around,
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

Sailin' down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
They're still talkin' about their card game on that Jackson River Queen.
""I've come to win some money,"" Gamblin' Willie says,
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his.
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town.
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
He supported all his children, and all their mothers too.
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore,
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor.
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true.
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

It was late one evenin' during a poker game,
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame.
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
When Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

So all you rovin' gamblers, wherever you might be,
The moral of this story is very plain to see.
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop,
For when you pull that dead man's hand, your gamblin' days are up.
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

19000,/bob-dylan/,Rank Strangers to Me,"Well, I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
Ev'rybody I met was a rank stranger to me.

Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
Ev'rybody I met, rank strangers to me.

""Well, they all moved away"" said the voice of a stranger
""To some beautiful home on that bright, crystal sea""
Some beautiful day, well, I'll meet 'em in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me.

Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
"
19001,/bob-dylan/,Restless Farewell,"Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully.
But the bottles are done,
We've killed each one
And the table's full and overflowed.
And the corner sign
Says it's closing time,
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.

Oh ev'ry girl that ever l've touched,
I did not do it harmfully.
And ev'ry girl that ever I've hurt,
I did not do it knowin'ly.
But to remain as friends and make amends
You need the time and stay behind.
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past,
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.

Oh ev'ry foe that ever I faced,
The cause was there before we came.
And ev'ry cause that ever I fought,
I fought it full without regret or shame.
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Must meet the dawn.
And if I see the day
I'd only have to stay,
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.

Oh, ev'ry thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung.
But it's not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes,
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
But the time ain't tall,
Yet on time you depend and no word is possessed
By no special friend.
And though the line is cut,
It ain't quite the end,
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me.
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face,
And the dust of rumors covers me.
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick,
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick.
So I'll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn.

From the city that dreams,
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
Cross the valleys and streams,
For they're deep and they're wide
And the world's on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride.

Ring them bells st. peter
Where the four winds blow,
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know.
Oh it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow.

Ring them bells sweet martha,
For the poor man's son,
Ring them bells so the world will know
That god is one.
Oh the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With lost sheep.

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Ring them bells for all of us
Who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many
When the game is through.
Ring them bells, for the time that flies,
For the child that cries
When innocence dies.

Ring them bells st. catherine
From the top of the room,
Ring them from the fortress
For the lilies that bloom.
Oh the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong."

19005,/bob-dylan/,"Rock, Salt and Nails","On the banks of the river, where the willows hang down
Where the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound
Down in the hollow where the water runs cold
It's there I have listened to the lies that you told

Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
The past I remember, time cannot erase
The letters you wrote me were written in shame
And I know that your conscience still echos my pain

Now the nights are so long, my sorrow runs deep
Nothing is worse than a night without sleep
I walk out alone, I look at the sky
Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry

Now if the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes
I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrels with them high bushy tails
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock, salt and nails"
19006,/bob-dylan/,Roll On John,"Doctor, doctor, tell me the time of day
Another bottle's empty
Another penny spent
He turned around and he slowly walked away
They shot him in the back and down he went

Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John
From the Liverpool docks to the red light Hamburg streets
Down in the quarry with the Quarrymen.
Playing to the big crowds Playing to the cheap seats
Another day in your life until your journey's end
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John

Sailing through the tradewinds
Bound for the sun
Rags on your back just like any other slave
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave

Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John
I heard the news today, oh boy
They hauled your ship up on the shore
Now the city's gone dark
There is no more joy
They tore the heart right out and cut it to the core

Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John
Put on your bags and get âem packed.
Leave right now you won't be far from hine
The sooner you go, the quicker you'll be back
You've been cooped up on an island far too long

Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John
Slow down you're moving too fast
Come together right now over me
Your bones are weary
You're about to breathe your last
Lord, you know how hard that it can be

Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John
Roll on John, roll through the rain and snow
Take the righthand road and go where the buffalo roam
They'll trap you in an ambush before you know
Too late now to sail back home

Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John
Tyger, Tyger burning bright
I pray the lord my soul to keep In the forest of the night
Cover him over and let him sleep
Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John."

Ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine

Sooner or later, you too shall burn

The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
The night is filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom

Let's put our heads together now, let's put all old matters to an end

Dust on my face and my cape,

Sold my guitar to the baker's son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
But I can get another one
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone.
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.

Was it me that shot him down in the cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone.
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.

Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town.
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.

The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun.
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me, don't say a word
Oh, can it be that I am slain?

Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

19009,/bob-dylan/,Ruben Remus,"(by J.R. Robertson and R. Manuel)

Wrote a letter this mornin',
Put it in your hat,
'Cause no one to read it
And I know you knew that.
I bought a joke, a trick or two,
Just to bring and show you,
Caught ya with the trickster too.
Sometimes I wonder how ya knew
A hypnotist, fancytalker,
Ruben Remus ain't no doctor

I knew the man and tried to remember
Just where it was that I'd seen his face.
Long ago, in a movie show,
He was like that man singin' bass.
Knew him by his nurs'ry rhyme:
The Story Of The Rabbit Man.
Fell right in and said to him:
""I'd like to help you if I can.""
I know the film would only shock ya,
Ruben Remus ain't no doctor!

He only needed what you had,
Asked for nothing more,
Said he'd like to take you on,
But it's been done before.
You couldn't see he's a travelin' man
And he cannot take your hand.
It's very hard to understand
Why his songs were never banned.
Guess the man would never knock ya,
Ruben Remus ain't no doctor!

No one seen ya since he's been gone,
It's been a day, maybe more.
I took a walk in your yard
And knocked on your back door.
Why don't you let me in?
I'm not the man who did ya in.
Is mr. Remus still your friend?
You say you don't remember him.
Turn me down, would ya?
Well, I've got news for you.
Turn me down would ya,
Can't ya tell
I'm gonna change your mind before I'm... trough...

And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes,
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes,
Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last,
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass,
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass,
Who among them do they think could carry you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace,
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace,
And your basement clothes and your hollow face,
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Who among them would try to impress you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,

And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs,

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you the dead angels that they used to hide.
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Oh, how could they ever mistake you?
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm,
And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
How could they ever, ever persuade you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row,
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold,
And your saint like face and your ghostlike soul,
Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?"

How did I meet you? I don't know.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.

Sara, oh Sara,
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Sara, Sara,
You must forgive me my unworthiness.

Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore.
You always responded when I needed your help,
You gimme a map and a key to your door.

Sara, oh Sara,
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Sara, oh Sara,
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go.

And rock about my Sarah Jane.

Captain gone through the hole-in-the-wall

19015,/bob-dylan/,Saved,"I was blinded by the devil,
Born already ruined,
Stone-cold dead
As I stepped out of the womb.
By His grace I have been touched,
By His word I have been healed,
By His hand I've been delivered,
By His spirit I've been sealed.

I've been saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved,
Saved,
And I'm so glad.
Yes, I'm so glad,
I'm so glad,
So glad,
I want to thank You, Lord,
I just want to thank You, Lord,
Thank You, Lord.

By His truth I can be upright,
By His strength I do endure,
By His power I've been lifted,
In His love I am secure.
He bought me with a price,
Freed me from the pit,
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it.

I've been saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved,
Saved,
And I'm so glad.
Yes, I'm so glad,
I'm so glad,
So glad,
I want to thank You, Lord,
I just want to thank You, Lord,
Thank You, Lord.

Nobody to rescue me,
Nobody would dare,
I was going down for the last time,
But by His mercy I've been spared.
Not by works,
But by faith in Him who called,
For so long I've been hindered,
For so long I've been stalled.

I've been saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved,
Saved,
And I'm so glad.
Yes, I'm so glad, I'm so glad,
So glad, I want to thank You, Lord,
I just want to thank You, Lord,
Thank You, Lord."
19016,/bob-dylan/,Saving Grace,"If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
I've escaped death so many times, I know I'm only
living
By the saving grace that's over me.

By this time I'd-a thought I would be sleeping
In a pine box for all eternity.
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
For the saving grace that's over me.

Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection,
Wherever I am welcome is where I'll be.
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Is the saving grace that's over me.

Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most
blinding,
But to search for love, that ain't no more than
vanity.
As I look around this world all that I'm finding
Is the saving grace that's over me.

The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary.
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
By the saving grace that's over me."
19017,/bob-dylan/,Scarlet Town,"In Scarlet Town, where I was born
There's ivy leaf and silver thorn
The streets have names that you can't pronounce
Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
The music starts and the people sway
Everybody says, ""Are you going my way?""
Uncle Tom still workin' for Uncle Bill
Scarlet Town is under the hill.

Scarlet Town in the month of May
Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
Kissin' his face and puttin' prayers on his head
So brave and true, so gentle is he
I'll weep for him as he would weep for me
Little Boy Blue come your blow horn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours,
There's palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
Beggars crouching at the gate
Help comes, but it comes too late
By marble slabs and in fields of stone
You make your humble wishes known
I touched the garment, but the hem was torn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

In Scarlet Town, the end is near
The Seven Wonders of the World are here
The evil and the good livin' side by side
All human forms seem glorified
Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
See who will hold you and kiss you good night
There's walnut groves and maplewood
In Scarlet Town cryin' won't do no good

In Scarlet Town, you fight your father's foes
Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
You fight 'em on high and you fight 'em down in
You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
You've got legs that can drive men mad
A lot of things we didn't do that I wish we had
In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear
You'll wish to God that you stayed right here

Set 'em Joe, play ""Walkin' the Floor""
Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
I'm staying up late, I'm making amends
While we smile, all heaven descends
If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
All things are beautiful in their time
The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
It's all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town"

You can see that my grave is kept clean.

And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground.

Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Means another poor boy is underground.

Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.

And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
Now I believe what the Bible told.

There's just one last favor I'll ask for you
And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
There's just one last favor I'll ask for you
See that my grave is kept clean.

From now on I'll be busy,
Ain't goin' nowhere fast.
I'm just glad it's over
And I'm seeing the real you at last.

Well, didn't I risk my neck for you,
Didn't I take chances?
Didn't I rise above it all for you,
The most unfortunate circumstances?

Well, I have had some rotten nights,
Didn't think that they would pass.
I'm just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last.

I'm hungry and I'm irritable
And I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix.

Well, I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast,
But the time has come
And I'm seeing the real you at last.

When I met you, baby,
You didn't show no visible scars.
You could ride like Annie Oakley,
You could shoot like Belle Starr.

Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble,
Trouble always comes to pass
But all I care about now
Is that I'm seeing the real you at last.

Well, I'm gonna quit this baby talk now,
I guess I should have known.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles,
I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.

Whatever you gonna do,
Please do it fast.
I'm still trying to get used to
Seeing the real you at last.

19022,/bob-dylan/,Series of Dreams,"I was thinking of a series of dreams
Where nothing comes up to the top
Everything stays down where it's wounded
And comes to a permanent stop
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
Nothing too very scientific
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Thinking of a series of dreams
Where the time and the tempo fly
And there's no exit in any direction
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes
Wasn't making any great connection
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Unless they're from another world

In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Not going to any great extremes
I'd already gone the distance
Just thinking of a series of dreams

19023,/bob-dylan/,Seven Curses,"Old Reilly stole a stallion
But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck.

Old Reilly's daughter got a message
That her father was goin' to hang.
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand.

When the judge he saw Reilly's daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Sayin', ""Gold will never free your father,
The price, my dear, is you instead.""

""Oh I'm as good as dead,"" cried Reilly,
""It's only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all.
Get on your horse and ride away.""

""Oh father you will surely die
If I don't take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice.
For that reason I will have to stay.""

The gallows shadows shook the evening,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
In the night the grounds were groanin',
In the night the price was paid.

The next mornin' she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken.
She saw that hangin' branch a-bendin',
She saw her father's body broken.

These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
That one doctor will not save him,
That two healers will not heal him,
That three eyes will not see him.

That four ears will not hear him,
That five walls will not hide him,
That six diggers will not bury him
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.

Maybe guilty of hesitatin', I just been holdin' on
Seven more days, all that'll be gone.

Thieving in the alley,
Fighting every inch of the way.

19029,/bob-dylan/,Shelter From The Storm,"I was in another lifetime;
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
And the road was full of mud.
I come in from the wilderness,
A creature void of form.
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her,
On that I give my word.
In a world of steel-eyed death
And men who are fighting to be warm,
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

Not a word was spoke between us.
There was little risk involved.
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved.
Try imagining a place where
It's always safe and warm.
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

I was burned out from exhaustion.
Buried in the hail.
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail.
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn.
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair.
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns.
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

Now there's a wall between us.
Something there's been lost.
I took too much for granted;
Got my signals crossed.
Just to think that it all began
On a non-eventfull morn.
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount,
But nothing really matters much.
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker;
He blows a futile horn.
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

I've heard newborn babies
Wailing like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love.
Do I understand your question, man?
Is it hopeless and forlorn?
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes.
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose.
I offered up my innocence
And got repaid with scorn.
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you
Shelter from the storm"".

Well, I'm living in a foreign country,
But I'm bound to cross the line.
Beauty walks a razor's edge.
Someday I'll make it mine.
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born.
""Come in"" she said, ""I'll give you

Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away.
My conscience is beginning to bother me today.

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.

Took a walk and passed your house
Late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn
Way down tight
From within, a dim light cast
Two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they ma-ade

Put his arms around your waist
Held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste
In the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy
Whose silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eye-eyes

Lost control and rang your bell
I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat
Down your door
When two strangers who had been
Two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock
Your on the wrong blo-ock

Rushed down to your house with wings
On my feet
Loved you like I never loved
You my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be
Two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days
Two silhouettes on the sha-ade

Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got
Seen better times, but who has not?

Silvio
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio
I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don't like it you can leave me alone

I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
And charm the whistle off an evening train

I give what I got until I got no more
I take what I get until I even the score
You know I love you and furthermore
When it's time to go you got an open door

I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don't complain

One of these days and it won't be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong

19036,/bob-dylan/,Simple Twist Of Fate,"They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark.
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones.
It was then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

They walked alone by the old canal.
A little confused, I remember well,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright.
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat up shade
Where he was waking up.
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up; the room was bare.
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care ;pushed the window open wide;
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks.
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailers all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again. How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate.

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within.
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.
She was born in spring, but I was born too late.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.

Just when she left me,
She gone to stay.

Quick as you can get a man.

Didn't know your name.

Or crave you in vain?

Down in the yard,
Gonna get me a freight train,

Well, this Arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot
But wouldn't tell me if what I had would last

She's calling me Stan
Or else she calls me Mister Clive

Have you anything to say to me
Won't you tell me where my love can be
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed

Oh skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go a-journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom-covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music of the night
Wonderful music
Faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there"
19040,/bob-dylan/,Slow Train,"Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
Can't help but wonder what's happenin' to my companions,
Are they lost or are they found, have they counted the cost it'll take to bring
down
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

I had a woman down in Alabama,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
She said, ""Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic.""
There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

All that foreign oil controlling American soil,
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed.
Sheiks walkin' around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose rings,
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and to Paris
And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

Man's ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don't apply no more,
You can't rely no more to be standin' around waitin'
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turnin' over in his grave,
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
All non-believers and men stealers talkin' in the name of religion
And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it.
They say lose your inhibitions, follow your own ambitions,
They talk about a life of brotherly love, show me someone who knows how to
live it. There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin' boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothin' I could do to stop it,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets,
There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you hear her call you across a crowded room

Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone
Once you have found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go"

Well, I don't want to brag, but I'm gonna wring your neck
When all else fails I'll make it a matter of self respect

It's just like you told me, just like you said it would be

The moon rising like wildfire
I feel the breath of a storm
Something I got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

Everybody thinks with their stomach
There's plenty of spies
Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear

Madame Butterfly, she lulls me to sleep
Like an ancient river
So wide and deep
She said, ""Be easy, baby, ain't nothin' worth stealin' here""

You're the one I've been waitin' for
You're the one I desire
But you must first realize
I'm not another man for hire

On the bandstand croon
September Song, Memphis in June
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a flaming red wig

I been to Babylon
I gotta confess
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness
What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.

Someone's got a hold of my heart

Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
Somethin' that crossed over from another century?

Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walkin' the hills of old Duluth.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.

Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things.
I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.

Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place.
My hand's on the sabre and you've picked up the baton
Somethin' there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.

Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign

You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file
What's your position, baby, what's going on?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?

I know everything about this place, or so it seems
Am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?

Something is burning, baby, here's what I say
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today
I see the shadow of a man, baby, makin' you blue
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?

We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?

I can feel it in the night when I think of you
I can feel it in the light and it's got to be true
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied

Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train
Answer me, baby, a casual look will do
Just what in the world has come over you?

I can feel it in the wind and it's upside down
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need but it ain't what you deserve

Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you

Hey, hey Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
'Bout a funny ol' world that's a-comin' along.
Seems sick an' it's hungry, it's tired an' it's torn,
It looks like it's a-dyin' an' it's hardly been born.

Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that I'm a-sayin' an' a-many times more.
I'm a-singin' you the song, but I can't sing enough,
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.

Here's to Cisco an' Sonny an' Leadbelly too,
An' to all the good people that traveled with you.
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.

I'm a-leaving' tomorrow, but I could leave today,
Somewhere down the road someday.

I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun

A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye

My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours

Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen

They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They lie and dine in their blood
Two timing slim
Who's every heard of him?
I'll drag his corpse through the mud

It's now or never
More than ever
When i met you id didn't think you do
Its soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you"

Into reach of your rattling drums.
Let me know, babe, about my fortune
Down along my restless palms.

Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast an' slashing,
An' your flashing diamond teeth.
The night is pitch black, come an' make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, I got to know, babe,
If it's you my lifelines trace.

I been wond'rin' all about me
Ever since I seen you there.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding,
I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where.
You have slayed me, you have made me,
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I got to know, babe, will I be touching you
So I can tell if I'm really real.

Still I say her love words over
Mostly when I'm all alone
Mi amor, mi cora sole.

Haven't seen her since that night
I can't cross the line you know
They want me for a gamblin' fight
Like as not it's better so
Still I always kind of missed her

I'm traveling by land
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind
I can't stay away

I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
We were meant to be more than friends

When you're near
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you, gal
You ought to be a fool about me

Can't explain
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart
You got the key to my brain

I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love

Life without you
Doesn't mean a thing to me
If I can't have you
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea

Sometimes I wonder
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day
And then you do wrong all night

When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter
What price I pay

They brag about your sugar
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down

I'm as pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them

I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me

I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind

Now your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind

I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me

From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can

I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back 'til fall

High on the hill
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two

I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there

You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin' good time"

And the doctor warned me I might catch a death.
Said, ""You can make it in your disguise,
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes.""

See the man with the stage fright,
Just standin' up there to give it all his might.
He got caught in the spotlight,
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again.

Now if he says that he's afraid,
Take him at his word.
And for the price that the poor boy has paid,
He gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh.

Your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry,
Fancy people go driftin' by.
The moment of truth is right at hand,
Just one more nightmare you can stand.

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might.
And he got caught in the spotlight,
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again, hmm hmm,

You wanna try it once again, hmm hmm,
Please don't make him stop, hmm hmm,
Let him take it from the top, hmm hmm,
Let him start all over again.

19055,/bob-dylan/,Standing In The Doorway,"I'm walking through the summer nights
Jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was going too fast
Today, it's moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you, if I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
I got nothing to go back to now

The light in this place is so bad
Making me sick in the head
All the laughter is just making me sad
The stars have turned cherry red
I'm strumming on my gay guitar
Smoking a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don't look like it will anytime soon
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Under the midnight moon

Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things I could say but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
I've been riding the midnight train
Got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Suffering like a fool

When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy, you'll roll no more
I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
I wonder who they're ringing for
I know I can't win
But my heart just won't give in
Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one
You left me standing in the doorway crying
In the dark land of the sun

I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care
It always means so much
Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
There are no words that need to be said
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Blues wrapped around my head
"
19056,/bob-dylan/,Stay With Me,"Should my heart not be humble
Should my eyes fail to see
Should my feet sometimes stumble
On the way, stay with me

Like the lamb that in springtime
Wanders far from the fold
Comes the darkness and the frost
I get lost
I grow cold

I grow cold, I grow weary
And I know I have sinned
And I go seeking shelter
And I cry in the wind
Though I grope and I blunder
And I'm weak and I'm wrong

Though the road buckles under
Where I walk, walk along
Till I find to my wonder
Every path leads to Thee
All that I can do is pray
Stay with me
Stay with me"

Ain't no lovin' since she been gone.

Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Speaking to some French girl,
Who says she knows me well.
And I would send a message
To find out if she's talked,
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,

Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line.
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine.
An' I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that,
But then again, there's only one I've met
An' he just smoked my eyelids
An' punched my cigarette.""

Grandpa died last week
And now he's buried in the rocks,
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked.
But me, I expected it to happen,
I knew he'd lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,

Now the senator came down here
Showing ev'ryone his gun,
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son.
An' me, I nearly got busted
An' wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile

Now the preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest.
But he cursed me when I proved it to him,
Then I whispered, ""Not even you can hide.
You see, you're just like me,
I hope you're satisfied.""
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile

Now the rainman gave me two cures,
Then he said, ""Jump right in.""
The one was Texas medicine,
The other was just railroad gin.
An' like a fool I mixed them
An' it strangled up my mind,
An' now people just get uglier
An' I have no sense of time.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile

When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
An' I say, ""Aw come on now,
You must know about my debutante.""
An' she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want.""
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb.
They all fall there so perfectly,
It all seems so well timed.
An' here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price

Going through all these things twice.

19060,/bob-dylan/,Sugar Baby,"Words and music by Bob Dylan

I've got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where you are

Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Plenty of places to hide things here if you want to hide them bad enough
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but you know she not really my aunt
Some of these memories, you can learn to live with and some of'em you can't

Sugar baby get on down the line, you ain't got no brains nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

The ladies down in Darktown, they're doin' the Darktown strut
Y'always got to be prepared, but you never know for what
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing

Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day, the bubble can burst
Try to make things better for someone sometimes you just end up makin' it thousand times worse

Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
You got a way of tearin' the world apart, love, see what you've done
Just as sure as we're livin', just as sure as you're born
Look up, look up, seek your Maker, 'fore Gabriel blows his horn

Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

Summer days and summer nights are gone

I've got a house on the hill, I got hogs out in the mud
I've got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
I've got a long haired woman, she got royal Indian blood

Everybody get ready, lift up your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready, lift up your glasses and sing
Well I'm standin' on the table, I'm proposin' a toast to the king

I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say ""You're a worn out star""
My pockets are loaded, and I'm spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else, you know it's me all the time

Well the fog's so thick you can't spy the land
Well the fog's so thick that you can't even spy the land
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?

Weddin' bells are ringin' and the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, the weddin' bells are ringin' and the choir's beginning to sing
What looks good in the day, at night is another thing

She's looking in to my eyes, and she's a-holding my hand
She looks in to my eyes, she's holding my hand
She say, ""you can't repeat the past,""
I say ""You can't? What do you mean you can't? Of course you can.""

Where do you come from, where do you go?
Sorry, that is nothing you would need to know

Why don't you break my heart one more time, just for good luck

Well, I got eight carburators and boys I'm usin' 'em all
I'm short on gas, my motor's startin' to stall

My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
I got my hammer ringin' pretty baby, but the nails ain't goin' down

If you got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Well, if you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police

Politician's got on his joggin' shoes
He must be runnin' for office, got no time to lose
Suckin' the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rollin' your eyes, you been teasin' me

Standin' by God's river my soul's beginning to shake
Standin' by God's river my soul's beginning to shake
I'm countin' on you, love, to gimme a break

Well, I'm leaving in the morning, as soon as the dark clouds lift
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning, just as soon as the dark clouds lift
I'm breakin' the roof, set fire to the place as a partin' gift

He gone North, he ain't around,
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here after sundown.
By the way, that's a cute hat,
And that smile's so hard to resist
But what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
She wanted a whole man, not just a half,
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child,
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear,
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know, a woman like you should be at home,
That's where you belong,
Watching out for someone who loves you true
Who would never do you wrong.
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know you can make a name for yourself,
You can hear them tires squeal,
You can be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.

You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before ya came in the door.
They say in your father's house, there's many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor.
Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you,
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Got to have done some evil deed,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.

They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings.
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Steal a lot and they make you king.
There's only one step down from here, baby,
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

Nothing can heal me now, but your touch

I was all right 'til I fell in love with you

Well my house is on fire; burning to the sky
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
Now I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do

Girls like birds flying away
When I'm gone you will remember my name
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame
I don't know what I'm gonna do

Junk is piling up; taking up space

Sweat falling down, I'm staring at the floor
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you

Well I'm tired of talking; I'm tired of trying to explain
My attempts to please you were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie bound
I just don't know what I'm gonna do

19065,/bob-dylan/,T.V. Talkin' Song,"One time in London I'd gone out for a walk,
Past a place called Hyde park where people talk
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.

There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
About the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes.
""It's too bright a light"", he said, ""For anybody's eyes,
If you've never seen one it's a blessing in disguise.""

I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Two men in front of me were coming to blows
The man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.

""The news of the day is on all the time,
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see.""

""Pray for peace!"". he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud,
""It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone
No one can protect you fro it once you turn it on.""

""It will led you into some strange pursuits,
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about,
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out.""

""It's all been designed"", he said, ""To make you lose your mind,
And when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.""
""Everytime you look at it, your situation's worse,
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse.""

The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran.
The T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me,
Later on that evening, I watched it on T.V..

Tell her that my ship set sail

And the shot from a carried gun
You better tell her that I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding-day
But please, don't mention the lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day.

But don't tell her all you know

Them Communists they wus comin' around,
They wus in the air,
They wus on the ground.
They wouldn't gimme no peace. .

So I run down most hurriedly
And joined up with the John Birch Society,
I got me a secret membership card
And started off a-walkin' down the road.
Yee-hoo, I'm a real John Bircher now!
Look out you Commies!

Now we all agree with Hitlers' views,
Although he killed six million Jews.
It don't matter too much that he was a Fascist,
At least you can't say he was a Communist!
That's to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria.

Well, I wus lookin' everywhere for them gol-darned Reds.
I got up in the mornin' 'n' looked under my bed,
Looked in the sink, behind the door,
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Couldn't find 'em . .

I wus lookin' high an' low for them Reds everywhere,
I wus lookin' in the sink an' underneath the chair.
I looked way up my chimney hole,
I even looked deep inside my toilet bowl.
They got away . .

Well, I wus sittin' home alone an' started to sweat,
Figured they wus in my T.V. set.
Peeked behind the picture frame,
Got a shock from my feet, hittin' right up in the brain.
Them Reds caused it!
I know they did . . them hard-core ones.

Well, I quit my job so I could work alone,
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes.
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they wus red stripes on the American flag!
That ol' Betty Ross . .

Well, I investigated all the books in the library,
Ninety percent of 'em gotta be burned away.
I investigated all the people that I knowed,
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go.
The other two percent are fellow Birchers . . just like me.

Now Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
To my knowledge there's just one man
That's really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell.
I know for a fact he hates Commies cus he picketed the movie Exodus.

Well, I fin'ly started thinkin' straight
When I run outa things to investigate.
Couldn't imagine doin' anything else,
So now I'm sittin' home investigatin' myself!
Hope I don't find out anything . . hmm, great God!

19070,/bob-dylan/,Talkin' World War Iii Blues,"Some time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three,
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say.
He said it was a bad dream.
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though,
They were my own dreams and they're only in my head.

I said, ""Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain""
He said, ""Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane""
He grabbed my arm, I said, ""Ouch!""
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said, ""Tell me about it""

Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast,
It was all over by quarter past.
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on.

Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town.
I stood a-wondering which way to go,
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road.
It was a normal day.

Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell,
""Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man.""
A shotgun fired and away I ran.
I don't blame them too much though,
I know I look funny.

Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man, I said, ""Howdy friend,
I guess there's just us two.""
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Thought I was a Communist.

Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave,
""Let's go and play Adam and Eve.""
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
When she said, ""Hey man, you crazy or sumpin',
You see what happened last time they started.""

Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody aroun',
I got into the driver's seat
And I drove 42nd Street
In my Cadillac.
Good car to drive after a war.

Well, I remember seein' some ad,
So I turned on my Conelrad.
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill,
So the radio didn't work so well.
Turned on my player-
It was Rock-A-Day, Johnny singin',
""Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa,
Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah.""

I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue,
I needed somebody to talk to.
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
""When you hear the beep
It will be three o'clock,""
She said that for over an hour
And I hung it up.

Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Sayin, ""Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams,
But mine was a little different you see.
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me.
I didn't see you around.""

Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody's having them dreams
Everybody sees themselves
Walkin' around with no one else
Half of the people can be part right all of the time
Some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can't be all right all of the time
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
""I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours""
I said that"

To this Bear Mountain Picnic.
But little did I realize
I was in for a picnic surprise.
Had nothin' to do with mountains.
I didn't even come close to a bear.

Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier,
Six thousand people there,
Everybody had ticket for the trip.
""Oh well."" I said, ""it's a pretty big ship.
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier.""

Well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think,
That big old boat started t' sink
More people kept a-pilin' on,
That old ship was a-slowly goin' down.
Funny way t' start a picnic.

Well, I soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife,
So many people there I never saw in m' life
That old ship sinkin' down in the water,
Six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other,
Dogs a-barkin', cats a-meowin',
Women screamin', fists a-flyin', babies cryin',
Cops a-comin', me a-runnin'.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.

I got shoved down 'n' pushed around,
All I could hear there was a screamin' sound,
Don't remember one thing more,
Just remember walkin' up on a little shore,
Head busted, stomach cracked,
Feet splintered, I was bald, naked. .
Quite lucky to be alive though.

Feelin' like I climbed outa m' casket,
I grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket.
Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home,
Wishin' I'd never got up that morn.

Now, I don't care just what you do,
If you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you.
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanta hear it,
'Cause, see, I just lost all m' picnic spirit.
Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic. .
In the bathroom.

Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are gonna do f'r money.
There's a bran' new gimmick every day
Just t' take somebody's money away.
I think we oughta take some o' these people
And put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain . .
For a picnic.

19072,/bob-dylan/,Talking New York,"Ramblin' outa the wild West
Leavin' the towns I love the best
Thought I'd seen some ups and down
""Til I come into New York town
People goin' down to the ground
Buildings goin' up to the sky

Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowin' snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said
It was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn't feel so cold then

I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling,
rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village

I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffee-houses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, ""Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singer here""

Well, I got a harmonica job
begun to play
Blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved m' sound
He was ravin' about how he loved m' sound
Dollar a day's worth

And after weeks and weeks of hangin' around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid m' dues

Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didn't take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin' about
A lot of people don't have much food
On their table
But they got a lot of forks n' knives
And they gotta cut somethin'

So one mornin' when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long, New York
Howdy, East Orange"
19073,/bob-dylan/,Tangled Up In Blue,"Early one morning the sun was shining.
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed it all.
If her hair was still red.
Her folks, they said, our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough.
They never did like Mama's homemade dress.
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road,
Rain falling on my shoes,
Heading out for the east coast.
Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met.
Soon to be divorced.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could;
Abandoned it out west.
Split it up on a dark sad night;
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away.
I heard her say over my shoulder
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue.""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell,
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix,
But all the while I was alone.
The past was close behind.
I seen a lot of women,
But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer.
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair.
Said to me ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered something underneath my breath.
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe.
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said,
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me.
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs.
There was music in the cafe's at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out,
I became withdrawn.
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm going back again.
I got to get her somehow.
All the people we used to know;
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians.
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started.
I don't what they're doing with their lives,
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint.
We always did feel the same.
We just saw it from a different point of view.
Tangled up in blue."
19074,/bob-dylan/,Tattle O'Day,"I buyed me a little dog
Color it was brown
I learned him how to whistle
Sing and dance and run
His legs they were 14 yards long
His ears they were quite broad
Around the world in a half a day
And on him I could ride
Sing Tattle O? Day

I buyed me a little bull
About four inches high
Everybody feared him
That ever heard him cry
When he begins to bellow
It made such a melodious sound
And all the walls in London town
Came tumbling to the ground
Sing Tattle O? Day

I buyed me a flock of sheep
I thought they were all weathers
Sometimes they yield at wolves
Sometimes they yield at feathers
I think mine are the very best sheep
For yielding increase
For every full change of the moon
They bring both lambs and geese
Sing Tattle O? Day

I buyed me a little box
About four acres square
I filled it full of guineas
And silver so fair
Oh now I? m bound for turkey
I travel like an ox
And in my big chest pocket
I carry my little box
Sing Tattle O? Day

I buyed me a little hen
All speckled gay and fair
I sat her on an oyster shell
She hatched me out a hare
The hare it sprang a handsome horse
Blew fifteen hens high
And him that tells a bigger tale
Would have to tell a lie
Sing Tattle O? Day"
19075,/bob-dylan/,Tears of Rage,"We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day,
And now you'd throw us all aside
And put us on our way.
Oh what dear daughter 'neath the sun
Would treat a father so,
To wait upon him hand and foot
And always tell him, ""No""?
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone
And life is brief.

We pointed out the way to go
And scratched your name in sand,
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand.
Now, I want you to know that while we watched,
You discover there was no one true.
Most ev'rybody really thought
It was a childish thing to do.
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so low
And life is brief.

It was all very painless
When you went out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe.
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse.
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so low
And life is brief.

19079,/bob-dylan/,Tell Ol' Bill,"The river whispers in my ear
I've hardly a penny to my name
The heavens have never seemed so near
All my body glows with flame
The tempest struggles in the air
And to myself alone I sing
It could sink me then and there
I can hear the echoes ring

I tried to find one smilin' face
To drive the shadow from my head
I'm stranded in this nameless place
Lyin' restless in a heavy bed
Tell me straight out if you will
Why must you torture me within?
Why must you come down off your high hill?
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind

Far away in a silent land
Secret thoughts are hard to bear
Remember me you'll understand
Emotions we can never share
You trampled on me as you passed
Left the coldest kiss upon my brow
All my doubts and fears have gone at last
I've nothing more to tell you now

I walk by tranquil lakes and streams
As each new season's dawn awaits
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams
The enemy is at the gate
Beneath the thunder-blasted trees
The words are ringin' off your tongue
The ground is hard in times like these
Stars are cold, the night is young

The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare
Iron clouds go floatin' by
Snowflakes falling in my hair
Beneath the gray and stormy sky
The evenin' sun is sinking low
The woods are dark, the town is too
They''ll drag you down, they run the show

Ain't no tellin' what they'll do
Tell ol' bill when he comes home
Anything is worth a try
Tell him that I'm not alone
That the hour has come to do or die
All the world I would defy
Let me make it plain as day
I look at you now and I sigh
How could it be any other way?"
19080,/bob-dylan/,Tempest,"The pale moon rose Explainin it's glory
Out on the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a golden age foretold

The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn?t stand here long

He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep

Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last

The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

The watchman lay there dreaming
At fourtyfive degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
It'd be the last trip of his life

Calvin, Blake and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale on the disembark

Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

The bishop left his cabin
To help others in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""

Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

Jim Dandy smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

The battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn?t hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

Leo said to Cleo
I think I?m going mad
But he?d lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

Petals fell from flowers
?Til all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
On the judgement of God's hand

The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
Love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea"

Lean against your velvet door.

Who crawls across your circus floor.

19085,/bob-dylan/,The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,"Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,
They were the best of friends.
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day,
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain,
Sayin', ""Take your pick, Frankie Boy,
My loss will be your gain.""

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin,
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him,
His head began to spin.
""Would ya please not stare at me like that,"" he said,
""It's just my foolish pride,
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide.""

Well, Judas, he just winked and said,
""All right, I'll leave you here,
But you'd better hurry up and choose
Which of those bills you want,
Before they all disappear.""
""I'm gonna start my pickin' right now,
Just tell me where you'll be.""

Judas pointed down the road
And said, ""Eternity!""
""Eternity?"" said Frankie Lee,
With a voice as cold as ice.
""That's right,"" said Judas Priest, ""Eternity,
Though you might call it 'Paradise.'""

""I don't call it anything,""
Said Frankie Lee with a smile.
""All right,"" said Judas Priest,
""I'll see you after a while.""

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down,
Feelin' low and mean,
When just then a passing stranger
Burst upon the scene,
Saying, ""Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler,
Whose father is deceased?
Well, if you are,
There's a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest.""

""Oh, yes, he is my friend,""
Said Frankie Lee in fright,
""I do recall him very well,
In fact, he just left my sight.""
""Yes, that's the one,"" said the stranger,
As quiet as a mouse,
""Well, my message is, he's down the road,
Stranded in a house.""

Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked,
He dropped ev'rything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand.
""What kind of house is this,"" he said,
""Where I have come to roam?""
""It's not a house,"" said Judas Priest,
""It's not a house . . it's a home.""

Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled,
He soon lost all control
Over ev'rything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll.
He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun,
With four and twenty windows
And a woman's face in ev'ry one.

Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap,
And, foaming at the mouth,
He began to make his midnight creep.
For sixteen nights and days he raved,
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest,
Which is where he died of thirst.

No one tried to say a thing
When they took him out in jest,
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest.
And he just walked along, alone,
With his guilt so well concealed,
And muttered underneath his breath,
""Nothing is revealed.""

Well, the moral of the story,
The moral of this song,
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong.
So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin',
Help him with his load,
And don't go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road.

19086,/bob-dylan/,The Ballad of Ira Hayes,"Gather round you people and a story I will tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms wene crops of weeds
But when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men
But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again
And when the fight was over and the old glory raised
One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian, no money crops, no chance
And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian's
dance
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

19087,/bob-dylan/,The Boxer,"I'm just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squadered my resistance
For a pocketful of numbles
Such are promises, all lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest.

When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know.

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there.

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains.

We talked of all, we talked of nothing
I left with promises to meet, she told me where

Oh, but she laughed each time I asked her name
Made promises to meet again

Don't leave your mother and a home so dear

And I took that girl to be my wife

And her lovin' eyes were blue

She left me all alone
Now I remember what my momma said
""Never trust the girl on the greenbriar shore. """

Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent
Felt around for the light switch, became nauseated.
She was walking down the hallway while the walls deteriorated.

East of the Jordan, hard as the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the page, Curtain risin' on a new age,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your shyness for snobbery,
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
About the madness of becomin' what one was never meant to be.

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the stage,
Curtain risin' on a new age,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me.
But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she didn't make me feel so obligated.

West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the cage,
Curtain risin' on a new stage,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
I see people who are supposed to know better standin' around like furniture.
There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it,
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to
keep it.

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the stage, Curtain risin' on a new age,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

Cities on fire, phones out of order,
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
What can I say about Claudette?
Ain't seen her since January,
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.

West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the stage,
Curtain risin' on a new age,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

19095,/bob-dylan/,The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,"William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'.
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.

William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling,
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.

Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen.
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.

In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence.
Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now's the time for your tears.

Just to know that you are near,
Sets my a heart a-reeling

Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day
Soft through the dark

The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer was he than I

He answered with his thumb,
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.

He stayed behind the assembly hall,
It was there he made his bed,
Oftentimes he could be seen returning.
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read,
""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning.""

Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part,
And the people that confronted him were many.
And he was told but these few words,
Which opened up his heart,
""If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any.""

Each one playing a horn,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
They've been there since Christmas morn.
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
A man with a badge skips by,
Three fellas crawlin' on their way back to work,
Nobody stops to ask why.
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Where the angels stand high on their poles,
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
In this concrete world full of souls.
The angels play on their horns all day,
The whole earth in progression seems to pass by.
But does anyone hear the music they play,
Does anyone even try?

19109,/bob-dylan/,Thunder On The Mountain,"Thunder on the mountain, and there's fires on the moon
A ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go

I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee

Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
The writing on the wall, come read it, come see what it say

Thunder on the mountain, rollin' like a drum
Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
I don't need any guide, I already know the way
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day

The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town
The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need

I've been sittin' down studyin' the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today

Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing

Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St. Herman's church, said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows

I got the porkchops, she got the pie
She ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams

Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies in Washington scrambling to get out of town
Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down

Everybody going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could, I did it right there and then
I've already confessed - no need to confess again

Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself"
19110,/bob-dylan/,Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love),"Well, I had to move fast
And I couldn't with you around my neck.
I said I'd send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven't even started yet.
I'll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out.
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about.
Someday maybe
I'll remember to forget.

I'm gonna get my coat,
I feel the breath of a storm.
There's something I've got to do tonight,
You go inside and stay warm.

Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love.
I don't know,
Has anybody seen my love?

You want to talk to me,
Go ahead and talk.
Whatever you got to say to me
Won't come as any shock.
I must be guilty of something,
You just whisper it into my ear.
Madame Butterfly
She lulled me to sleep,
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep.
She said, ""Be easy, baby,
There ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here.""

You're the one I've been looking for,
You're the one that's got the key.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you
Or you're too good for me.

Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love.
I don't know,
Has anybody seen my love?

Well, they're not showing any lights tonight
And there's no moon.
There's just a hot-blooded singer
Singing ""Memphis in June,""
While they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
Who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Later he'll be shot
For resisting arrest,
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness.
What looks large from a distance,
Close up ain't never that big.

Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine,
Never could learn to hold you, love,
And call you mine.

19111,/bob-dylan/,Time Passes Slowly,"Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream,
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.

Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin',
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin',
Stared out the window to the stars high above,
Time passes slowly when you're searchin' for love.

Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair.
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right,
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day,
Time passes slowly and fades away."
19112,/bob-dylan/,Tin Angel,"It was late last night when the boss came home
To wander early his mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said boss the ladies gone
She left this morning just before dawn

You got something to tell me, tell it to me man
Come to the point as straight as you can
Old henry lee chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand

The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late

Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by put up a prayer

Well they rode all night and they rode all day
Eastward long on the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went

He came to a place where the land was dull
His poor head pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain

Well he threw down his helmet and his cross handle sword
He renounced his faith he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all

He leaned down cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness caught a glimpse of the two
Hard to tell for certain who was who

He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quickening every vein
His knuckles were bloody he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair

They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit inseparably linked
Got a strange premonition there's a man close by
Don't worry about him he wouldn't harm a fly

From behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race

She turned she was startled by a look of surprise
With the hatred that could hit the skies
You're a reckless fool I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise

Get up stand up you greedy lipped wench
And cover your face with some other consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes on double quick

Sill boy you think me a saint
To listen no more to your words of complaint
You've given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes

Id have given you the stars and the planets too
What good are these things to you
By the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world you see

Oh please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold
Oh my dear you must be blind
He's a gutless ape with a worthless mind

You've had your way too long with me
Now its me who will determine how things will be
Tried to escape he cussed and cursed
You'll have to try get passed me first

I dared not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you sir you can not deny
You made a monkey of me for what and for why

Ill have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you I'll see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle you'll wish you died

The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
The first bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted bin

He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He grabbed the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth he's as good as dead

You shot my husband down you fiend
Husband what, husband what the hell do you mean
He was man of strife a man of sin
I cut him down and I throw him to the wind

Hear this she said with angry breath
You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life
And she raised her robe and she drew out a knife

His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
You're a murderous woman and bloody wife
If you dont mind ill have the knife

We're two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But we're no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men is all I knew
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow

His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His doom was sealed he slipped to the floor
He whispered in her ear this is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt

She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
You die for me I will die for you
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it though

All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day"

With only you in view
While evening slips away
It only goes to show
That while life's pleasures be few

Is when I'm alone with you.

To be with the one you love
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
But you're always what I'm thinkin' of

Shut softly your watery eyes.
The pangs of your sadness
Shall pass as your senses will rise.
The flowers of the city
Though breathlike, get deathlike at times.
And there's no use in tryin'
T' deal with the dyin',
Though I cannot explain that in lines.

Your cracked country lips,
I still wish to kiss,
As to be under the strength of your skin.
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I'm in.
But it grieves my heart, love,
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist.
It's all just a dream, babe,
A vacuum, a scheme, babe,
That sucks you into feelin' like this.

I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
By worthless foam from the mouth.
I can tell you are torn
Between stayin' and returnin'
On back to the South.
You've been fooled into thinking
That the finishin' end is at hand.
Yet there's no one to beat you,
No one t' defeat you,
'Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.

I've heard you say many times
That you're better 'n no one
And no one is better 'n you.
If you really believe that,
You know you got
Nothing to win and nothing to lose.
From fixtures and forces and friends,
Your sorrow does stem,
That hype you and type you,
Making you feel
That you must be exactly like them.

I'd forever talk to you,
But soon my words,
They would turn into a meaningless ring.
For deep in my heart
I know there is no help I can bring.
Everything passes,
Everything changes,
Just do what you think you should do.
And someday maybe,
Who knows, baby,
I'll come and be cryin' to you.

To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""

With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Persecution, execution, governments out of control.
You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble.

Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble,
Nothin' but trouble.

Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Since the beginning of the universe man's been cursed by trouble.

Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble,
Nothin' but trouble.

Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed.
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble.

Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble,
Nothin' but trouble.

19125,/bob-dylan/,True Love Tends to Forget,"I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes
When she's near me she's so hard to recognize.
I finally realize there's no room for regret,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

Hold me, baby be near,
You told me that you'd be sincere.
Every day of the year's like playin' Russian roulette,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

I was lyin' down in the reeds without any oxygen
I saw you in the wilderness among the men.
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.

You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
You're a hard worker, baby, and I know you well.
But this weekend in hell is making me sweat,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

I was lyin' down in the reeds without any oxygen
I saw you in the wilderness among the men.
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.

You belong to me, baby, without any doubt,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out.
Don't keep me knockin' about from Mexico to Tibet,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Trust yourself,

Don't trust me to show you beauty
When beauty may only turn to rust.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.

Trust yourself,
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Trust yourself,
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Don't trust me to show you the truth
When the truth may only be ashes and dust.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.

Well, you're on your own, you always were,
In a land of wolves and thieves.
Don't put your hope in ungodly man
Or be a slave to what somebody else believes.

Trust yourself
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
Trust yourself
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Don't trust me to show you love
When my love may be only lust.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.

19127,/bob-dylan/,Tryin' To Get To Heaven,"The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains
When you think that you lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what ""all right"" even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door

Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before
I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door

Didn't have no place to go
Could hear may people, cryin' ""lord, have mercy""
'Cause you're the only one that we can turn to""

Happened a long time ago
A little town
Way back in mississippi
In tupelo
There was women, and there was children
They were screamin' an' cryin'
Cryin', ""lord, have mercy

Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee
They're throwin' knives into the tree
Two big bags of dead man's bones
Got their noses to the grind stone
Livin' in the Land of Nod
Trustin' their fate to the hands of God
They pass by so silently
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee

Well, they're goin' to the country, they're goin' to retire
They're takin' a streetcar named Desire
Lookin' at a window with a pecan pie
Lot of things they'd like they would never buy
Neither of them want to turn and run
They're makin' a voyage to the Sun
""His Master's Voice is calling me""
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee

Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum
I'll have more than some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the police
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
""Your presence is obnoxious to me.
Feel like baby sittin' on a woman's knee.""
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee

Well, the rain beat'n' down on a window pane
I got love for you, and it's all in vain
Brains in a pot, they're beginning to boil
They're drippin' with garlic and olive oil
Tweedle Dee is on his hands and his knees
Sayin', ""Throw me something, Mister, please!""
""What's good for you is good for me,""
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.

Well, they're living in a happy harmony
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee
They're one day older and a dollar short
They got a parade permit and a police escort
They're lyin' low and they're makin' hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick 'n' tile company
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee

Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred creed
My pretty baby, she's looking around
She's wearin' a forty-thousand dollar gown
Tweedle Dee is a low down sorry old man
Tweedle Dum he'll stab you where you stand
""I've had too much of your company,""

19131,/bob-dylan/,Two Soldiers,"He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
His voice was low with pain.
""I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
If I ride back again.
But if you ride back and I am left,
You'll do as much for me,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
So write to her tenderly.

""She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Her fond face pale with woe.
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
I'll see her soon, I know.""
Just then the order came to charge,
For an instance hand touched hand.
They said, ""Aye,"" and away they rode,
That brave and devoted band.

Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks,
And guarded them as they fell.
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain,
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again.

But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair.
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there.
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said.
Momma, you know, awaits the news,
And she'll only know he's dead.

It's unbelievable it would get this far.

It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
It's indescribable it can drive you to drink.
They said it was the land of milk and honey,
now they say it's the land of money.
Who ever thought they could ever make that stick.

Bridge #1:
Every head is so dignified, every moon is so sanctified,
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
All the silver, all the gold, all the sweethearts you can hold
That don't come back with stories untold, are hanging on a tree.

It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
It's so impossible to even learn the tune.
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Feed that horse and saddle up the drum.
It's unbelievable, the day would finally come.

Bridge #2:
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
He stood beneath the silver skies
And his heart began to bleed.
Every brain is civilized,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Everything is criticized when you are in need.

It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Turn your back, wash your hands,
There's always someone who understands
It don't matter no more what you got to say
It's unbelievable it would go down this way.

Don't know how much of this I can take,

I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Baby, oh what a story I could tell.

It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.

I'd like to help you but I'm in a bit of a jam,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.

But I will be back, I will survive,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive.
Baby, can't you tell.

Well it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
I'm starin' at your picture, I'm hearin' your words.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.

Everywhere you go it's enough to break hearts
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.

Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Don't think I 'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Baby, is there anything left to tell?

I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.

Pray that I don't die of thirst,

And the car I drive is a Chevrolet,
It was put together down in Argentina
By a guy makin' thirty cents a day.

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the U.S.A.
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way.

Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the pearls are from Japan.
Well, the dog collar's from India
And the flower pot's from Pakistan.
All the furniture, it says ""Made in Brazil""
Where a woman, she slaved for sure
Bringin' home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve,
You know, that's a lot of money to her.

Well, it's sundown on the union

Well, you know, lots of people complainin' that there is no work.
I say, ""Why you say that for
When nothin' you got is U.S.-made?""
They don't make nothin' here no more,
You know, capitalism is above the law.

You just build it cheaper someplace else.

They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
The unions are big business, friend,
And they're goin' out like a dinosaur.

I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Is gonna be against the law.

Democracy don't rule the world,
You'd better get that in your head.
This world is ruled by violence
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
That's a lot of territory indeed
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.

19137,/bob-dylan/,Up to Me,"Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Death kept followin', trackin' us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy,
I know you're long gone,
I guess it must be up to me.

If I'd thought about it I never would've done it, I guess I would've let it slide,
If I'd lived my life by what others were thinkin', the heart inside me would've died.
I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity,
Someone had to reach for the risin' star,
I guess it was up to me.

Oh, the Union Central is pullin' out and the orchids are in bloom,
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously,
Somebody's got to find your trail,
I guess it must be up to me.

It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
I'd just about convinced myself that nothin' had changed that much.
The old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key,
Somebody had to unlock your heart,
He said it was up to me.

Well, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
I would've followed you in the door but I didn't have a ticket stub.
So I waited all night 'til the break of day, hopin' one of us could get free,
When the dawn came over the river bridge,
I knew it was up to me.

Oh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Was I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?
You looked a little burned out, my friend,
I thought it might be up to me.

Well, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat,
She's everything I need and love but I can't be swayed by that.
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
But she ain't a-gonna make me move,
I guess it must be up to me.

We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty,
Somebody's got to tell the tale,
I guess it must be up to me.

Well, Dupree came in pimpin' tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Well, I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company,
But you ain't a-gonna cross the line,
I guess it must be up to me.

There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle,
She's the one you been wond'rin' about, but there's really nothin' much to tell.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history,
Somebody's got to cry some tears,
I guess it must be up to me.

So go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property,
One of us has got to hit the road,
I guess it must be up to me.

And if we never meet again, baby, remember me,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free,
No one else could play that tune,
You know it was up to me.

19138,/bob-dylan/,Visions of Johanna,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded,
Though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain,
temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot
where the ladies play blindman's bluff
With the key chain
And the all-night girls
they whisper of escapades out on the train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna
have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery,
he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
while I'm in the hall
How can I explain?
Oh, it's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna,
They kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation
must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say,
""Jeeze I can't find my knees""
Oh, jewels and binoculars
hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna,
they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess
Who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""Ya can't look at much, can ya man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna
are now all that remain"

Like he was a king.
Hopin' to get you
Behind a wood pilin',
Inside the walls,
The walls of Red Wing.

The night aimed shadows
Through the crossbar windows,
And the wind punched hard
To make the wall-siding sing.
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleepin',
Inside the walls,
The walls of Red Wing.

As the rain rattled heavy
On the bunk-house shingles,
And the sounds in the night,
They made my ears ring.
'Til the keys of the guards
Clicked the tune of the morning,
Inside the walls,
The walls of Red Wing.

Oh, some of us'll end up
In St. Cloud Prison,
And some of us'll wind up
To be lawyers and things,
And some of us'll stand up
To meet you on your crossroads,
From inside the walls,
The walls of Red Wing.

19144,/bob-dylan/,Waltzing With Sin,"Someday you'll find
That the world's left you out
No true love, no nothing
Just roaming about
Parties and people
And a cold heart within
And each time you're dancing
You're waltzing with sin

You're satan made over
In perfect disguise
Unfaithful, unworthy
And oh so unwise
I pity the heart
Of the next guy you win
Like me you'll be losing
While waltzing with sin

Let's try it again
Some day you'll find
That the world's left you out
No true love, no nothing
Just roaming about

Well, parties and people
And a cold heart within
And each time you're dancing
You're waltzing with sin
You're satan made over
In perfect disguise
Unfaithful, unworthy
And oh so unwise

I pity the heart
Of the next guy you win
Like me you'll be losing
While waltzing with sin"

Wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio,
Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne,
Wherever you might look tonight, you might see this wanted man.

I might be in Colorado or Georgia by the sea,
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be.
If you ever see me comin' and if you know who I am,
Don't you breathe it to nobody 'cause you know I'm on the lam.

Wanted man by Lucy Watson, wanted man by Jeannie Brown,
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson, wanted man in this next town.
But I've had all that I've wanted of a lot of things I had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad.

I got sidetracked in El Paso, stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way into Juarez with Juanita on my lap.
Then I went to sleep in Shreveport, woke up in Abilene
Wonderin' why the hell I'm wanted at some town halfway between.

Wanted man in Albuquerque, wanted man in Syracuse,
Wanted man in Tallahassee, wanted man in Baton Rouge,
There's somebody set to grab me anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight, you might get a glimpse of me.

Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo,
Wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio,
Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne,
Wherever you might look tonight, you might see this wanted man."
19146,/bob-dylan/,Watching the River Flow,"What's the matter with me,
I don't have much to say,
Daylight sneakin' through the window
And I'm still in this all-night cafe.
Walkin' to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rollin' slow,
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow.

Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand,
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand.
If I had wings and I could fly,
I know where I would go.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow.

People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah,
Makes you stop and all wonder why.
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldn't help but cry.
Oh, this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,
And as long as it does I'll just sit here
And watch the river flow.

People disagreeing everywhere you look,
Makes you wanna stop and read a book.
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook.
But this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,
And as long as it does I'll just sit here
And watch the river flow.

Watch the river flow,
Watchin' the river flow,
Watchin' the river flow,
But I'll sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow.

19147,/bob-dylan/,Watered Down Love,"Love that's pure hopes all things,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome,
Capture your heart and hold it for ransom.

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that's pure, it don't make no claims,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Will not deceive you or lead you to transgression,
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Won't hold you back, won't mess up your day,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes,
It don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious.

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that's pure ain't no accident,
Always on time, is always content,
An eternal flame, quietly burning,
Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning.

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love
"
19148,/bob-dylan/,We Better Talk This Over,"I think we better talk this over
Maybe when we both get sober
You'll understand I'm only a man
Doin' the best that I can.

This situation can only get rougher.
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways
Before we decay.

You don't have to be afraid of looking into my face,
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.

I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance
Of a downhill dance.

Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
I'm exiled, you can't convert me.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways
With both eyes glazed.

You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.

I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
If I have to beg, steal or borrow.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half
Look at each other and laugh.

But I don't think it's liable to happen
Like the sound of one hand clappin'.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
'Neath the bed where we slept.

Don't think of me and fantasize on what we never had,
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.

Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.

Oh, babe, time for a new transition
I wish I was a magician.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
That we've both gone beyond.
"
19149,/bob-dylan/,Wedding Song,"I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,
Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.

Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun,
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give,
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole,
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul.

You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie,
I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.

It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge,
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend,
And if there is eternity I'd love you there again.

Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Just bein' next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.

19150,/bob-dylan/,Went to See the Gypsy,"Went to see the gypsy
Stayin' in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me coming
And he said, ""Well, well, well""
His room was dark and crowded
Lights were low and dim
""How are you?"" he said to me
I said it back to him

I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there
And she began to shout
""Go on back to see the gypsy
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas
And he can do it here""

Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears
I watched them from the distance
With music in my ears

I went back to see the gypsy
It was nearly early dawn
The gypsy's door was open wide
But the gypsy was gone
And that pretty dancing girl
She could not be found
So I watched that sun come rising
From that little Minnesota town"
19151,/bob-dylan/,What Can I do For You?,"You have given everything to me.
What can I do for You?
You have given me eyes to see.
What can I do for You?

Pulled me out of bondage and
You made me renewed inside,
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied,
Opened up a door no man can shut and
You opened it up so wide
And You've chosen me to be among the few.
What can I do for You?

You have laid down Your life for me.
What can I do for You?
You have explained every mystery.
What can I do for You?

Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly,
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to
die?
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do.
What can I do for You?

You have given all there is to give.
What can I do for You?
You have given me life to live.
How can I live for You?

I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart.
Well, I don't deserve it but I sure did make it
through.
What can I do for You?"
19152,/bob-dylan/,What Good Am I?,"What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
If I just turned away, when I see how you're dressed,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
What good am I?

What good am I if I know and don't do,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky,
What good am I?

What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
What good am I?

What good am I then to others and me
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see
Bridge: If my hands tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been

What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
What good am I?

What was it you wanted,
Could you say it again?
I'll be back in a minute
You can get it together by then.

What was it you wanted
You can tell me, I'm back,
We can start it all over
Get it back on the track,
You got my attention,
Go ahead, speak.
What was it you wanted
When you were kissing my cheek?

Was there somebody looking
When you give me that kiss
Someone there in the shadows
Someone that I might have missed?
Is there something you needed,
Something I don't understand.
What was it you wanted,
Do I have it here in my hand?

Whatever you wanted
Slipped out of my mind,
Would you remind me again
If you'd be so kind.
Has the record been breaking,
Did the needle just skip,
Is there somebody waitin',
Was there a slip of the lip?

What was it you wanted
I ain't keepin' score
Are you the same person
That was here before?
Is it something important?
Maybe not.
What was it you wanted?
Tell me again I forgot.

Whatever you wanted
What could it be
Did somebody tell you
That you could get it from me,
Is it something that comes natural
Is it easy to say,
Why do you want it,
Who are you anyway?

Is the scenery changing,
Am I getting it wrong,
Is the whole thing going backwards,
Are they playing our song?
Where were you when it started
Do you want it for free
What was it you wanted
Are you talking to me?

For all these earthly things ?

It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn
For like a thief in the night, He'll replace wrong with right
When He returns.

Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease
Until He returns?

Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask,
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned,
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne
When He returns.

On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece.
She promised that she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece.

Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum,
Dodging lions and wastin' time.
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em,
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory,
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese.
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece.

Sailin' 'round the world in a dirty gondola.
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!

I left Rome and landed in Brussels,
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried.
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles,
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside.
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police.
Someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent
When I paint my masterpiece.

19160,/bob-dylan/,When The Deal Goes Down,"In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
Where wisdom grows up in strife
My bewildered brain, toils in vain
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
Tomorrow keeps turning around
We live and we die, we know not why
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down

We eat and we drink, we feel and we think
Far down the street we stray
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Things I never meant nor wished to say
The midnight rain follows the train
We all wear the same thorny crown
Soul to soul, our shadows roll
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

Well, the moon gives light and it shines by night
When I scarcely feel the glow
We learn to live and then we forgive
O'r the road we're bound to go
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
That keep us so tightly bound
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

Well, I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
I followed the winding stream
I heard the deafening noise, I felt transient joys
I know they're not what they seem
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
You'll never see me frown
I owe my heart to you, and that's sayin' it true
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down"
19161,/bob-dylan/,When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky,"Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile.
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
You've had time to think about it for a while.

Well, I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high.
It won't matter who loves who,
You'll love me or I'll love you
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape.
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With disaster that you managed to escape.

I can't provide for you no easy answers,
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You'll know all about it, love,
It'll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called.
I've never asked you for nothing you couldn't deliver,
I've never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.

I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die.
Stick around, baby, we're not through,
Don't look for me, I'll see you
When the night comes falling from the sky.

In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line.
I don't want to be a fool starving for affection,
I don't want to drown in someone else's wine.

For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that's howling in your eye.
You will seek me and you'll find me In the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling from the sky.

Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
But you were gambling for support.
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
When my memory is not so short.

This time I'm asking for freedom,
Freedom from a world which you deny.
And you'll give it to me now,
I'll take it anyhow
When the night comes falling from the sky.

19162,/bob-dylan/,When the Ship Comes In,"Oh the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'.
Like the stillness in the wind
'Fore the hurricane begins,
The hour when the ship comes in.

Oh the seas will split
And the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking.
Then the tide will sound
And the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking.

Oh the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling.
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand,
The hour that the ship comes in.

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken.
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean.

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline.
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck,
The hour that the ship comes in.

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'.
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'.

Oh the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'.
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that it's for real,
The hour when the ship comes in.

Then they'll raise their hands,
Sayin' we'll meet all your demands,
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered.
And like Pharaoh's tribe,
They'll be drownded in the tide,
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered.

19163,/bob-dylan/,When You Awake,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. So I
walked on down the road a mile, Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, And what do you think he said to me?

(Chorus:)
When You Awake you will remember ev'rything, You will be
hangin' on a string from your... When you believe, You will relieve the only
soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road.
You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

(Repeat Chorus)

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard itwhen I was very small.

(Repeat Chorus)

Wash my hand in lye water, I got a date with the
captains daughter. You can go and tell your brother. We sure gonna
love one another, Oh! You
may be right and ya might be wrong, I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, My old car froze
up last night. Ain't no reason to hang your head I could wake up in the
mornin' dead. Oh! And
if I thought it would do any good, I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood.
"
19164,/bob-dylan/,Where Are You Tonight?,"There's a long-distance train rolling through the rain, tears on the letter I write.
There's a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much but she's drifting like a
satellite. There's a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze, laughter down on
Elizabeth Street
And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone where she bathed in a stream of pure
heat. Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise but he practiced
what he preached from the heart.
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me the time and the place that
the trouble would start.

There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
Of a book that no one can write.
Oh, where are you tonight?

The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure, to live it you have to explode.
In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed, sacrifice was the code of the road.
I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John, strong men belittled by doubt.
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were but she had some way of finding
them out. He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same, she was waiting,
putting
flowers on the shelf.
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair and discovered her invisible self.

There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped,
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape,
I won't, but then again, maybe I might.
Oh, if I could just find you tonight.

I fought with my twin, that enemy within, 'til both of us fell by the way.
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees while the law looks the other way.
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes, the guy you were lovin'
couldn't stay clean.
It felt outa place, my foot in his face, but he should-a stayed where his money was
green.
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit with the juice running down my leg.
Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss and who always was
too proud to beg.
There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room and a pathway that leads
up to the stars.
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise, remind me to show you the
scars.

There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived.
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived.
I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive,
But without you it just doesn't seem right.
Oh, where are you tonight?
"
19165,/bob-dylan/,Where Are You?,"Where are you, where have you gone without me
I thought you cared about me, where are you
Where's my heart, where is the dream we started
I can't believe we're parted, where are you

When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending, where are you

When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain

19166,/bob-dylan/,Where Teardrops Fall,"Far Away where the soft wind blow,
Far away from it all,
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall.

Far away in the stormy night,
Far away and over the wall,
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall.

We banged the drum slowly
And played the fife lowly
You know the song in my heart
Bridge: In the turning of twilight
In the shadows of moonlight
You can show me a new place to start

I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup
Strippin' away at it all,
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall.

By rivers of blindness,
In love and with kindness
We could hold up s toast if we meet
Bridge: To the cuttin' of fences
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat.

Roses are red, violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl,
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall.

19172,/bob-dylan/,With God on Our Side,"Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I's taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side.

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh the country was young
With God on its side.

The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too was
Soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I's made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side.

The First World War, boys
It came and it went
The reason for fighting
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side.

The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side.

I've learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side.

But now we've got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side.

Through many dark hour
I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side.

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
That if God's on our side
He'll stop the next war."

Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad

My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
While I'm listening to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it's way into my gut

Chorus:
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

Well, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall
I'll sell 'em to their enemies
I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away

Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man, no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can feel a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death

(chorus)

Well, they burned my barn, and they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me?

Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with your words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true, everything you've heard

(chorus)

In you, my friend, I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so

Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone, I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means

19178,/bob-dylan/,Yazoo Street Scandal,"(by J.R. Robertson)



Stranded out in the night,
Eliza took me down
To see the widow give
Rain to the town.
It's against the law
To be a tonic man,
But the widow knows
She's got the upper hand.
So I went on in
Feelin' kinda wheezy.
You know she soothed my mind, boys,
She rocked me kinda slow and easy
All day and all night.

Pick a card before you go
It's a long trip to Mexico.

Eliza wait by the door,
I can't stay here anymore, no, no.

Then she took a pill
She washed her feet in the mud
She said ""Look out son,
You know, I just ordered a flood
For forty days and forty nights"".

Then I dropped my shoes,
Eliza called my name.
She said it looked to her
Like it's gonna rain.
Then the cotton king
Came in chokin'
And the widow laughed and said:
""I ain't jokin'.
Take once for all""
She said ""Now don't ya tease me.
I just fell in love, boy,
So rock me kinda slow and kinda easy,
All day and all night.""

Sweet William said
With a drunken head:
""If I had a boat,
I'd help y'all float"".
Eliza stood there watching,
William in a trance,
As the widow did the St. Vitus dance.
But just then an old man
With a boat named ""Breezy""
Said: ""You can ride with Clyde, boys,
If you rock it kinda slow and easy,
All day and all night"".

Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand, and

Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed

The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
And ye shall be changed

You drink bitter water
And you been eating the bread of sorrow
You can't live for today
When all you're ever thinking of is tomorrow
The path you've endured has been rough
And when you've decided that you've had enough, then

Truce makers and partakers
Of every selfish whim

And you running back to him

Oh but what a shame, that all we've shared can't last
I can change I swear
Oh, see what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too

A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream
I'm going out of my mind
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to the heart
Ever since we've been apart

19188,/bob-dylan/,You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,"I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
Been shootin' in the dark too long
If something's not right it's wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love
It always has hit me from below
But this time it's more correct
Right on target so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover Queen Anne lace
Crimson hair across your face
You can make me cry if you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoiling me too much love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could spend forever with you and never realise the time

Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But there's no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to

I'll look for you in old Honolula
San Francisco, Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now I know
But I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Give you my money, honey,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lawd, Lawd.

You're gonna quit me, baby,
Put me outta doors, Lawd, Lawd.

Six months on the chain gang,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lawd, Lawd.

Day you quit me, baby,
That's the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.

Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lawd, Lawd.

Day you quit me, baby,
That's the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.
"
19190,/bob-dylan/,You're No Good,"Well I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in.

Well sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
When you get a crazy notion of jumpin' all over me
Well you give me the blues I guess you're satisfied
An' you give me the blues I wanna lay down and die.

I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand
You're takin' all my money and give it to another man.

Well you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brain
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die

Well you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die"
19191,/bob-dylan/,Young At Heart,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you
If you're young at heart

For it's hard you will find
To be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart

You can go to extremes
With impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams
Fall apart at the seams

And life gets more exciting
with each passing day
And love is either in your heart
Or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth
To be young at heart

For as rich as you are
It's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start
If you are among the very
Young at heart

And if you should survive
To a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start
If you are among the very
Young at heart

And if you should survive
To a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start
If you are among the very
Young at heart"

I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I've always loved you and made you happy,
And nothing else could come between.
But now you've left me to love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all:
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all:
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

31750,/johnny-cash/,(Ghost) Riders in the Sky,"An old cowpoke went ridin' out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
Come rushin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath you could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders coming hard... and he heard their mournful cry

Yipie i oh Yipie i ay
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their face is gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked
With sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they 'aint caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever in the range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire as they ride hard hear them cry

The riders leaned on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a riding on our range
Then cow - boy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch this devil herd... a - cross these endless
Skies.

When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,

But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probally drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigarrs.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd free me from this prison,

I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
far from Folsom prison is where I want to stay

He said before the sherrif comes i wanna tell you, listen boy,
said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to

John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
the babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he siad i'll pay you quarter at a time, sartin tommorow, thats the pay for a steel driver on this line

Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, i see you brought you own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?
and he said, I can turn a jack, i can lay a track, i can pick a shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy?)
i can i'll do anything oyu hire me to

now aint you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer

he said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, i'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do

With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a fay for driven steel,
(sewat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel

Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring,

but the bad boss come up laguhing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gona get a steam drill to do your share of driven, then whats all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you

John Henry said i feed four little brothers, and baby sisters walking on her knees, did the lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and whats a subsitute for bread and beans, i saint seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam

John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill

John Henry said to his captain, a man aint nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, i'll beat it fair and honest, i'll die with my hammer in my hand, but i'll be laughing, cuz you cant replace a steel driven man

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, i suppose you didnt hear me, i said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin to you

2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountains caving in, John Henry told the captain, thell the kind fols not to worry, that aint nothin but my hammer suckin wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle i intend,

Captain tell the people move back further, i'm at the finish line and i aint no drill, shes so far behind you aint got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, lord lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills

Well John Henry had a little woman, i believe the lady's name was polly ann, yeah that was his good woman, john henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here polly ann come here sugar, ya know i believe this is the first time i ever watched the sun come up that i couldnt come up

Take my hammer polly ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'l all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them thats not all i can do, tell em i can hoist a jack, and i can lay a track, i can pick and shovel too, aint no machine can, thats been proved to you

There was a big crowd of moarners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails john henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the palce John Henrys laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clikty clak, clikty clak, down there lies a steel driven man oh lord, down there lies a steel driven man, down there lies a steel driven man oh lord, down there lies a steel driven man"

31765,/johnny-cash/,In My Life,"There are places I'll remember
All my life
Though some have changed
Some forever
Not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all

But if all these friends and lovers
There is no one
Compares with you
And these memories
Lose their meaning
When I think of love
As something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
In my life
I love you more

And it burns,burns,burns
The ring of fire

Whose dear forms you often miss
When you close your earthly story
Will you join them in their bliss?

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, by and by
In a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

In the joyous days of childhood
Oft' they told of wond'rous love
Pointed to the dying Saviour
Now they dwell with him above.

Will the circle be unbroken

You can picture happy gath'rings
'Round the fireside long ago
And you think of tearful partings
When they left you here below.

31768,/johnny-cash/,Backstage Pass,"Hello I'm Johnny Cash
One night I had a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson Show

There were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
There was leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson Show

Kristofferson got an offer for a movie promoters closed another deal or two
Waylon got a call from his son Shooter and he went home the minute he was through
I moved with the mob at intermission
To the green room where you see who you can see
There were has-been's and would-be's and never-were's
Paupers punks and millionaires and me
And there were wackoes...
[ guitar ]
Hells Angels blocked the traffic to the building
In order for the beer truck to come through
And waitin' in the wings to sing with Willie were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude
There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties
Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song
There were women who once did and some who still would
I heard one ask did Connie come along
And there were wackoes...
I wish you could've been there well maybe you were"
31769,/johnny-cash/,A Boy Named Sue,"My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk,
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean,
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame.
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name.

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry,
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon on a street of mud,
There at a table, dealing stud,
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had,
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old,
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now your gonna die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise,
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when,
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first,
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.

And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along.
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong.""

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do.
But ya ought to thank me, before I die,
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you ""Sue.'""

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son,
And I came away with a different point of view.
And I think about him, now and then,
Every time I try and every time I win,
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!"

But at the end of the day, when your work is done
You ain't got nothin' but fun

Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a hollow log
Well, he comes in a run, when you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two, and your dog and you
When you get your rabbit, you'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried

Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes

Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills

While you put him on a hook and you drop him in a brook
If everything's gonna turn out right, you're gonna fry fish tonight

Country boy, got alot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes

Country boy, you got work to do

You gotta plant the seed, you gotta cut the weeds

She soon could wear a cocktail dress again
But we get along without cocktails, mighty fine
This will be our first and I'm proud the baby is mine

Yes, I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And 'cause I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
And if you just mind your own business we'd be fine
Don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine

She's awkward, yeah, but have you seen her face
Where there once was shame there's a sparkle in it's place
And her conscience is clear that's why her eyes shine
Mister don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine

I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And 'cause I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
If you'd mind your own business we'd make it fine
Tell all her old friends I'm proud the baby is mine"
31772,/johnny-cash/,(The) Timber Man,"Many, many years ago
When this land was young
A lot of our country was covered
By big tall beautiful trees

And men had to have the trees
To make wood, to build houses
Make furniture with, to make boats
Even to make paper with

So as more and more people came
More wood was needed
So more and more trees
Were cut down

And the man that lived in the forest
And cut down the trees
Was called the Timber man

Well, my world is green and dark and dumb
My home is in the loggin' camp
All week I cut down the mighty trees
Saturday I get to do as I please

I give the man more than his hire
And he'll never know it if I tire
Show me the toughest tree around
The Timber man will bring it down

Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in-between
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man

Yeah, he was a mighty big tough man usually
That Timber man that lived in that forest
And cut down those big trees

Well, they say there's sawdust in my brain
And don't get caught out in the rain
I got stump water in my blood
The sweat from my brow turns the ground to mud

When the men don't know how to fell a tree
The one they'll come and ask is me
I'll mark my spot and I'll take my stand
The tree's gonna fall for the Timber man

Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in-between
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man

And when they're cuttin' on a tree
And it's just about ready to fall
The man yells out timber, timber"

31776,/johnny-cash/,A Croft In Clachan,"With the campbells and mcdonalds, it was in their blood to fight
With each passing generation it became a mans birthright
But they always had a common enemy
Never would the english crown take scottish independency

Oh the battles rage in glasgow and majestic edinburgh
And they came with war machines and in the highlands shots were heard
Then the people rose in union and the forces moved as one
And the clans all joined together to see english on the run
And in a tiny croft in clachan sat a mother, peg macdunn
And she sewed the cords together for her 16 year old son
And she cried as he was leaving, donÃ¢
And come you back to clachan when the english are all done

Now rob macdunn was ready as the left the croft behind
And he joined the highland pipe brigade with one thing on his mind
That to keep his home and freedom he must face it like a man
So he marched in common union with his musket in his hand
And he met the hill of battle in the highlands and the low
And the reason for the fighting long within his blood to know
In the middle of the rumble he was forward gaining ground
And the bagpipes still were playing as the dead lay all around

Then he moved in no direction till he faced the winds of north
And he boldly climbed the highlands, further from the firth of forth
Then one freezing, blowing morning, came the cry of peg macdunn
Back to my croft in clachan god has sent me home my son
And in another croft in clachan cross the way from the macdunnÃ¢
With her face against the window sat a young girl, tired and worn
And she smiled a secret knowing as she breathed a prayer alone
I thank thee lord for bringing rob macdunn back safely home

Back to the croft in clachan, he returned to peace again
He had gone a boy of 16, but he came back as a man."
31777,/johnny-cash/,A Legend In My Time,"If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game,
I'd be a legend in my time.
If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets,
I'd be a legend in my time.

But they don't give awards, and there's no praise or fame
For hearts that are broken for love that's in vain.

If loneliness meant world acclaim,
Everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time."

For old times sake give me a slow heartbreak
I put up a fight but I'll be all right
if you stop lovin' me a little at a time

Hurt me a little at a time, turn me away a little at a time
Walk away slow like you don't want to go leave me,

You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way

But little they know
That itÂ´s so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind

Once I was waitinÂ´
In fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for
To get a start in lifeÂ´s game

Then suddenly it happened
I lost every dime
But IÂ´m richer by far
With a satisfied mind

Money canÂ´t buy back
Your youth when youÂ´re old
Or a friend when youÂ´re lonely
Or a love thatÂ´s grown cold

The wealthiest person
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind

When my life has ended
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
IÂ´ll leave thereÂ´s no doubt

But one thingÂ´s for certain
When it comes my time
IÂ´ll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind

How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way

But little they know
That itÂ´s so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind"

But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of man who would gamble on love
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
Like the rules that govern our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love

It can lift you up, it can put you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love
Men like me they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with a livin' to worry about a little word like love

And then I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I say thank God this world will win with the thing called love"

I remember him fondly well his name was Abner Brown
I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown and nobody knew when he came to town
But he spread good will to his fellow men and they let him sleep in the cotton gin
He could drink more brew than an army could
But he had more friends and he did more good
Than a lot of fine fancy people in our town so they tolerated Abner Brown
And all us kids were on his side cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide
And he made us feel bout ten feet tall cause he had no kids but he claimed us all
And after school and on weekends you could find me down at the cotton gin
The truest friend that I ever found was a good old drunk named Abner Brown
Abner Brown I wish that I could see you once again
I believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men
I've met and known in all the low and higher places that I've been
Thinking of you picks me up when I'm feeling down
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown

Lord take me back to the cotton land to Arkansas take me home again
Let me be the boy that I once have been let me walk that road to the cotton gin
He's probably dead many years ago and gone the way that old drunks go
But I'd still like to sit me down talk to my old friend Abner Brown

Cause from those total wages earned down to that net amount that's due
I feel the painful sense of loss between the two
There goes that bracelet for her arm there goes that new fence for my farm
There goes that brand new Pontiac there goes the shirt right off my back
You can dream about a honeymoon for two
You can dream but that's about all you can do
Cause by the time old Uncle Sam gets through with you
You can buy her a pair of hose a little powder for her nose
And take her down to Sloppy Joe's for beer and stew them are the facts after tax
You can dream about vacation in the sun
You can dream but you can't never have you one
Cause by the time your good old Uncle Sam gets done
You've got just enough for gas to see them city limits pass
And if you get back home fourth class I'd say you won
There goes that bracelet for her arm there goes that new fence for my farm
Send back that short wave radio cancel that trip to Mexico
Forget that brand new Pontiac there goes the shirt right off my back"

I've got no one to tell my troubles to
No one to care to call my own

The day you left you broke my heart
I need you so but we're so far apart
You didn't care I should have known
That you would go and leave me all alone

How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found

Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall posess within the veil
A life of joy and peace

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun"

And quite by chance he rode into the light
A man wild as the dust devil with no place to run livin' by his wits and by his gun
He met a girl like none he had ever known she cared not for the wild oats he had sown
And so he laid his gun down and set his spirit free began living in respectability
But his old ways of thinkin' wouldn't die could not forget the old creed he lived by
And the good and bad and right and wrong kept fightin' for his soul
Till his heart and mind both went out of control

But now the old saloon had lost its spell what once was laughter now was living hell
And the hookers guns and drinkin' in his life were out of place
And in his mind he saw an angel's face
So he burned all his bridges in a day and the devil deeds were done and laid away
And he rode out a better man than when he first rode in
And the angel got the badman in the end"

Is my name whispered in your bedside prayers
Do you feel a vacant spot beside you there

Well there's always one more path that I must walk
And there's people I should sit down with and talk
And somebody might appreciate the flowers I could bring
So there's always another song to sing
[ dobro ]
Do you tell them I was wilder than the wind
Do you remember that I needed lots of friends
And at other times I'd rather be alon
Where I could not be found when I was gone

To touch the things left by those gone before
At the top of the tiniest hill I can feel like I'm a king
And there's always another song to sing"

When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below

His steel grey eyes were blazing when he saw me
His hand was on his gun when he rode up
He said you killed that woman I know you shot her why'd you do it
I'm taking you to Austin then I'm gonna lock you up

Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning
And he had me deep in Texas the next day
A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin
But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away
[ ac.guitar ]
A jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their eyes
They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her
And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die

Now all I want between me and there are a lot of friendly people
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles"

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is neigh.

Believe me, Lord Jesus, I asked thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with thee there.

Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you
(How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung 'round her by the score
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the
candy store

(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)

She was tops in all they said
It never once went to her head
She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen
(Not a care, this teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the

(Dream on, dream on teenage queen you should be a

He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out
(Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy
store

(Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town
(But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store

(Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train

31805,/johnny-cash/,Ballad Of Barbara,"In a southern town where I was born that's where I got my education
I worked in the fields and I walked in the woods and I wondered at creation
I recall the sun in the skies of blue and the smell of green things growin'
And I lived everyday and I lived anyway anyway the wind was blowin'
But then I heard of a cultured city life breath taking lofty steeples
And the day I called myself a man I left my land and my people

And I rambled north and I rambled east and I tested and I tasted
And a girl or two took me around and around but always left me wasted
In the world that's all concrete and steel with nothin' green ever growin'
Where the buildings hide the risin' sun and stop the free wind from blowin'
Where they sleep all day and they wake all night to a world of drink and laughter
I met that girl that I thought would be the one that I was after

In a soft blue gown and a formal tux beneath that lofty steeple
He said do you Barbara take this man will you be one of his people
And she said I will and she said I do and the world looked mighty pretty
And we lived in a fancy downtown flat cause she loved the noisy city
Then the days grew cold beneath the yellow sky and I longed for green things growin'
And I talked of home and my people there but she'd not agreed a goin'

Then her hazel eyes turned away from me with the look that wasn't very pretty
And she turned into concrete and steel and she said I'll take the city
Now the cars go by on the Interstate and my pack is on my shoulder
And I'm goin' home where I belong much wiser now and older"
31806,/johnny-cash/,Ballad Of Boot Hill,"Here lies less more four slugs from a forty-four no less no more

Out in Arizona just south of Tucson
Where tumbleweeds tumble in search of a home
There's a town they call Tombstone where the brave never cry
They live by a sixgun by a sixgun they die

It's been a long time now since the town was a boom
The jailhouse is empty so's the Palace Saloon
Just one look will tell you that this town was real
A secluded old dirt road leads up to Boot Hill

Walk up to the fence there and look at the view
That's where they were hanging eighteen eighty two
It's easy to see where the brave men have died
Rope marks on the oak tree are now petrified

At night when the moon shines so far away
It gets mighty lonesome lookin' down on their graves
There lies Billy Clanton never wanted to kill
But he's there with the guilty way up on Boot Hill (Boot Hill)"

Ira Hayes

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war


There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died

Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

And my wife forever be

And had no other words to say

And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me

I drug her down to the river-side
An I there threw her into drown

And if you spoke at all, you'd just said hi to Big John.
Somebody said he came from New Orleans,
Where he got into a fight over a Cajun Queen.
And a crash and a blow from a huge right hand,
sent a Lousiana fella to the promise land.

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine,
when a timber cracked and men started crying.
Minors were praying, and hearts beat fast
and everybody thought they had breathed thier last
cept' John.
Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell,
walked a giant of a man that the minors knew well.
Grabbed a sagging timber and gave out with a groan,
and like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, Big John

Big John
Big John
Big Bad John
Big John

And with all of his strength, he gave a mighty shove.
Then a minor yelled out, 'theres a light up above!'.
And 20 men scrambled from a 'would be' grave
now theres only one left down there to save, Big John.
With jacks and timbers, they started back down,
then came that rumble way down in the ground.
And as smoke and gas smelched out of that mine,
everybody knew it was the end of the line, for Big John.

Big John
Big John
Big Bad John
Big John

Now they never re-opend that wortheless pit,
they just placed a marble stand in front of it.
These few words are written on that stand,
'At the bottom of this mine, lies one Hell of a man, Big John'

31819,/johnny-cash/,Big Battle,"I think sir the battle is over and the young soldier laid down his gun
I'm tired of running for cover I'm certain the bottle is done

For see over there where we fought them it's quiet for they've all gone away
All left is the dead and the dying the Blue laying long side the Gray

So you think the battle is over and you even lay down your gun
You carelessly rise from your cover for you think the battle is done

Now boy hit the dirt listen to me for I'm still the one in command
Get flat on the ground here beside me and lay your ear hard to the sand

Can you hear the deafening rumble can you feel the trembling ground
It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound

For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life
There lies your friend Jim McKenney can you take the news to his wife

No son the battle's not over the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun

The fight yet to come's not with cannon nor will the fight be hand to hand
No one will regroup the forces no charge will a general command

The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife
Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives

Now go ahead rise from your cover be thankful that God let you live
Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give

I see sir the battle's not over the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun

For though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky
I'm dropping the gun and the sabre and ready for battle am I"
31820,/johnny-cash/,Big Foot,"Big Foot was an Indian chief of the Miniconioux Band
A band of Miniconioux Sioux from South Dakota land
Big Foot said to Custer stay away from Crazy Horse
But Custer crossed into Sioux land and he never came back across
Then Big Foot led his people to a place called Wounded Knee
And they found themselves surrounded by the 7th Calvary
Big chief Big Foot rise up from your bed
Miniconioux babies cry for their mothers lying dead
Big Foot was down with the fever when he reached Wounded Knee
And his people all were prisoners of the 7th Calvary
Two hundred women and children and another hundred men
Raised up a white flag of peace but peace did not begin
An accidental gunshot and Big Foot was first to die
And over the noise of the rifles you could hear the babies cry
Big chief Big Foot it's good that you can't see
Revenge is being robbed by Custer's 7th Calvary
Then smoke hung over the canyon on the cold December day
All was dead and dying around where Big Foot lay
Farther on up in the canyon some had tried to run and hide
But death showed no favors women men and children died
One side called that masacre the other a victory
But the white flag is still waving today at Wounded Knee
Big chief Big Foot your Miniconioux band
Is mourned and remembered here in South Dakota land
Big chief Big Foot your Miniconioux band
Is mourned and remembered here in South Dakota land"

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
A freighter said she's been here
But she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis,
But she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge,
River Queen, roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
Go on, I've had enough;
Dump my blues down in the gulf.
She loves you, Big River, more than me.

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

31832,/johnny-cash/,Boy Named Sue,"My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk,
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean,
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame.
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name.

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry,
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon on a street of mud,
There at a table, dealing stud,
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had,
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old,
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!?
Now your gonna die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise,
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when,
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first,
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.

And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along.
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong.""

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do.
But ya ought to thank me, before I die,
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Cause I'm the son-of-a-***** that named you ""Sue.'""

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son,
And I came away with a different point of view.
And I think about him, now and then,
Every time I try and every time I win,
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!"

She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine
Cry call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
[ guitar ]
Her mother wiped the tears and said see honey you're only dreaming
Your dad must work today he has to draw his pay
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine

Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground
The little girl was fast asleep yet cried out one more time
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
[ guitar ]
Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground
A dying man was found had survived all those around
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time
When he heard his own child whine call daddy from the mine
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine"
31843,/johnny-cash/,Call Of The Wild,"Bayou bayou bayou bayou
Now here's a little tale about a flock of geese
Lookin' for a home and lookin' for a peace
But before they're safely in the southern sand
They gotta watch out for the critter called man
There's a goose and a gander and a goslin' child
Headin' on south at the call of the wild
Honk and holler as we go gonna see the Gulf of Mexico
Way up high don't fly low the long toms will get you from the old bayou

Well the wind from the north it chills you to the bone
And the call of the wild is callin' me come home
I'll lead my band of geese a marry trip we'll navigate that mighty Mississipp'
Honk and holler as we go...
Bayou bayou bayou bayou

Honk and holler as we go...

My pappy led this band of twenty-three and the second in command included me
He made one fatal slip and he flew too low the long tom's got him from the old bayou
Honk and holler as we go..."
31844,/johnny-cash/,Call Your Mother,"When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had?
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

I always liked your family
We got along just splendidly
Though your brother
Kind of rubbed me the wrong way
I remember that your eyes turned green
When they crowned your sister County Queen
Though she couldn't hold a candle
To your beauty any day

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had?
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

Back when we could laugh and play
On family reunion day
Didn't we all look funny
In our 1950s clothes?
Your daddy wore that greasy stuff
Your brother drank more than enough
Your mom wore penny loafers
With runners in her hose

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had?
O gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother"
31845,/johnny-cash/,Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound,"Itâs a long and dusty road, itâs a hot and heavy load
And the people that you meet arenât always kind.
Some are bad, some are good, some have done the best they could
Some have tried to ease my troubled mind

(Refrain)
But I canât help but wonder
Where Iâm bound, where Iâm bound
I canât help but wonder where Iâm bound

I have been around this land just doing the best I can
Trying to find what I was meant to do
And the faces that I see are as worried as can be
And I think that they are wondering too

(Refrain)

I had a buddy way back home, till he started out to roam
Now I hear heâs out by Frisco Bay
Sometimes when Iâve had a few, his voice comes singing through
And Iâm going out to see him some old day

(Refrain)

If you see me passing by and you sit and wonder why
You werenât meant to be a rambler too
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace them up, and bar the door
And thank the stars for the roof thatâs over you

31846,/johnny-cash/,Cat's In The Cradle (cover),"A child arrived the other day,
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay,
He learned to walk while I was away,
And he was talking 'fore I knew it.
And as he grew he'd say, I'm gonna be like you dad,
You know I'm gonna be like you.

Chorus:
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
When you coming home dad? I don't know when,
But we'll get together then,
You know we'll have a good time then.

My son turned ten just the other day,
He said, Thanks for the ball come on let's play,
Can you teach me to throw? I said, Not today,
I got a lot to do. He said, That's okay.
He walked away but his smile never dimmed,
He said, I'm gonna be like him,
Yeah, you know I'm gonna be like him.

Chorus:
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
When you coming home dad? I don't know when,
But we'll get together then,
You know we'll have a good time then.

Well, he came from college just the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say,
Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while.
He shook his head and then he said with a smile,
What I'd really like dad is to borrow the car keys,
See you later can I have them please.

Chorus:
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
When you coming home son? I don't know when,
But we'll have a good time then dad,
You know we'll have a good time then.

I've long since retired my son's moved away.
I called him up just the other day,
I said, I'd like to see you if you don't mind.
He said, I'd love to dad if I could find the time,
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids
have the flu,
But it's sure nice talking to you dad,
It's been sure nice talking to you.

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me.

Chorus:
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
When you coming home son? I don't know when,
But we'll have a good time then dad,
You know we'll have a good time then..."
31847,/johnny-cash/,Chicken In Black,"For two long years my head hurt bad
So a doctor checked me an he shook his head
He said I'm sorry to tell you
But your body's outlived your brain
He said I know this doctor in New York, son
And he'll fix you right up with a brand new one
So the head doctor met me
When I stepped down off of the train.

He said we had this bank robber killed last night
His body's shot but his brain's alright
I'll give you a transplant, boy
And you'll be OK
I got my new brain in and I was feelin' great
I went right back to Nashville with no headache
But something strange happened
When I walked in the bank one day

CHORUS
I said stick 'em up ever'body I'm robbin' this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, why you're Johnny Cash
I said no ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York

Now the other night Roy Acuff called me
He said John I'd like for you to do the Opry
So I went out on the stage, but I couldn't sing
I got into a half a verse of 'I Walk The Line'
And something snapped in this head of mine
I yelled stick 'em up -
Give me your money, your watches and rings.

Well, I called New York and talked to that brain quack
And said Doc I gotta have my old brain back
He said I'm sorry there, Mr. Cash, but I can't do that
He said I put your brain in a chicken last monday
He's singing your songs and makin' lots of money
And I got him signed to a ten-year recording contract.

Now friends if you see me walkin' down the street
Remember what you see ain't necessarily me
And if I try to hold you up, don't pay me no mind
But when you got ten bucks that you can blow
You oughta catch that Johnny Chicken show
He's doin' fairs and concert dates
All up and down the line.

I said stick 'em up ever'body I'm robbin' this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, why you're Johnny Cash
I said no ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York.

TAG: TALK:
Well, I don't pay any income tax...
You don't pay tax on money you steal...
You oughta catch that Johnny Chicken show...

31850,/johnny-cash/,Cisco Clifton's Fillin' Station,"Cisco Clifton had a fillin' station about a mile and a half from town
Most cars passed unless they were out of gas so Cisco was always around
Regular gas was all that it sold except tabacco matches and oil
Other than that he fixed lots of flats keepin' Cisco rough hands soiled
He'd wipe the gas and check the air in a hundred times a day
He patiently gave directions on how to get to the state highway
Usually he'd give 'em water or a tyre or two some air
And once a big black Cadillac spent seven dollars there
He'd give anybody anything they'd ask and lend anything he had
His tools are tyres bumperjacks or wire to the good ones or the bad
In wintertime there was a depot stove and a table for a checker game
And every mornin' at sunup the same checker players came
So Cisco Clifton's fillin' station was always in the red
Personal loans were personally gone but never a word was said
One mornin' at eight them checker players heard a big bulldozer roar like a freight
And Cisco said I hope my kids stay fed when they build that Interstate
He'd managed to pay for property where his little fillin' station sat
And friends still came for checker game so Cisco settled for that
He wouldn't say so but Cisco knew that the Interstate was too much to fight
But to keep his will and to pay his bills he did odd jobs at night
He still opened up at sunrise and the checker game went on
The cars flew past on hightest gas and the neighbors had sold out and gone
If a car ever did go by he was lost and if they stopped they were treated the same
So at Cisco Clifton's fillin' station there's a howdy and a checker game"

Bow my head and not a careless word is said
Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail

Well I was hangin' round the bus station
Mindin' my own business like I always do
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
And I thought I check out the action like I always do
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team
When she called the badge on me
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said
What are you doin' hangin' around here for
And I said for whatever's goin' around
City jail city jail...

He said no what I mean is what are you doin'
Sayin' things like that to that lady

And I said no that's how I act when I get hungry

And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head
And I said oooh don't hit me on the head
I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on
Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me again
And I said oh oh oh oh oh please don't stand on my feet when you hit me
I break my ankles when I fall

Well about that time they threw me in the wagon
And that waitress walked out with a sailor
I said hey you not you I'm talkin' to the purple people eater

31852,/johnny-cash/,City of New Orleans,"Ridin' on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
15 cars & 15 restless riders
Three conductors, and 24 sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey the train moves out of
Kentucky
And moves along past houses, farms & fields
Passin' trains that have no name, as which yardsâ full of old
black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

Chorus:
Good mornin' America, how are you?
Say Don't you know me? I'm your native son!
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Dealin' cards with the old men on the club car
Penny a point, ain't nobody keepin' score
Then now pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters & the sons of engineers
Ride their daddiesâ magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Repeat Chorus

Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by mornin'
Thru the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea

But all the towns & people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
""The passengers will please refrain:
This train has got to disappear in railroad blues.

I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico

Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
in walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down

Said yes oh yes my name is Willy Lee
if you've got the warrant just read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
they slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty heck into that district court

Into the courtroom my trial began
where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes in walked the man
holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
Oh, hollered Lord Lord, have a mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his ben
99 years in the Folsom pen
99 years underneath that ground

3. Medley:

(Ride this train
Ride this train with me to where the great Interstate highways cross the country
A hundred years ago over that very ground long before the roads were there
The lonely pony express rider carried the mail
Then came the stagecoach with people and supplies moving across country
Today carrying on that tradition is the modern mover of America
The man behind the wheel the truck driver)

SIX DAYS ON THE ROAD
(Earl Green - Carl Montgomery)
Â« Â© '58 Southern Arts Music, BMI Â»

Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh rolling down that eastern sea board
I got my diesel wound up and she's running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead well alright I don't see a car in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from her stack and the smoke's blowing black as coal
My home town is coming in sight if you think I'm happy you're right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

(Sixteen forward gears diesel smoke trailing in the wind
Eighteen tyres checked and singing on the pavement
Five thousand miles to cover three weeks away from home
And it's work Mister it demands the best
And whether your run is on Interstate 70 or hauling freight down the eastern seaboard
If you're a gear jammer you know there ain't no easy runs)

THERE AIN'T NO EASY RUN
(Tom T. Hall - Dave Dudley)
Â« Â© '68 Newkeys Music, BMI / Unichappell Music, BMI Â»

I was sittin' in the terminal waitin' for my load
When a greenhorn driver came in off of the road
I heard him tell that foreman get my little pink slip
This run is too tough and I'm gonna quit

Now the foreman that day happened to be old Joe
Man he was older than time
He said son how long you been driving this rig
You know I've drove all shapes forms fashions and kinds
And here you are worried about this one little trip
Why I've drove a million miles and then some
He looked that greenhorn right in the eye and he said
Boy there ain't no easy runs

I've drove for Roadway Interstate Hopewell Great Lakes
Walford Mac Time Mayflower Freight Lines
Specter Yellow Transit and Western and Gillete
Red Ball Rider North Western Big Seattle
Beaver Bell Hoover McLeans Gateway Motor Freight Transport Pikes
Dixie Ohio Trans American South East Tex Mason Dixon Watkin and Transcon
Wilson Associates got all that driving done
And I tell you boy there ain't no easy run

Said if you got a gal in Texas they'll send you up to Maine
And if you got a gal in New York they'll send you out on the plains
I know what your problem is you got woman trouble son
And I tell you boy there ain't no easy run

I've drove for Navajo Rate Goose DC
North American High Line Baltimore Freight Park
New Mac Curtis Eastern and then NX
Garrett Hayes Federal and ETM
And Neptune Herron Brinks and Sea Lab
First Dudley Dorsey Bekins and Billingham
Cooper Detroit Jones and American too
Nightway and Central Standard and Boston Sue
Yunham Buckingham got all that driving done
And I tell you boys there ain't no easy run

I've drove for United Acme Tanksley and Shaw
Grammar Atlas Strickland and Docks
Atlantic Owens Karin and Bullman H & H Murphy Field and Mohawk
Skill Skags got all the driving done
And I tell you boys there ain't no easy run
Ain't no easy run

(The next time you see a big semi roaring down the highway
Remember the man at the wheel has a great heritage in America
Like the Pony Express rider the stagecoach driver and the wagon master of old
No matter what the weather no matter where the road
He's the man that delivers the goods
And whatever you eat tonight whatever you wear wherever you sleep
Remember it's very likely that it was a trucker
That brought you your food clothers and your bed)

SAILOR ON A CONCRETE SEA

Well my ocean is four lanes wide my waves are mountain high
I sail a twenty ton schooner with the will of do or die
And my cargo must go through to the port that waits for me
I live on luck for I drive a truck I'm a sailor on a concrete sea
So here's to the unsung hero though he don't make history
From coast to coast let's drink a toast
To the sailor on a concrete sea the sailor on a conrete sea

(Most of my people and the people I knew back home
Made their greatest accomplishments in this life
By hard work with their two bare hands
When a fella has given life a good grind and is lying on his dying bed
With his hands folded crossed his chestbone
Feeling the last pumping of his innard workings
One of his good folks ought to raise up his head a tad
And let him take one fadin' look through his eyes once again at his own two hands
And he ought to be proud in his head if he can say
Concernin' them hands that all their lying by has been laid by proper
And that's a bunch of times I have done somethin' pretty good with 'em)"

But the grounds to wet for the hopper now.
Got a cultivator and a double tree
A leather line for the hull and gee
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for Country Trash

I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
I got about a dollar laid away
The winds from the south and the fishings good
Got a pot belly stove a cord of wood
Mama turns the left-overs into hash I'm doing alright for
Country Trash

I got a mackinaw and a hunting dog
A cap I ordered from the catolog
A big tall tree that shades the yard A big fat sow for the winters lard
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for
Country Trash

Well there's not much new ground left to plow
And the crops need fertilizer now
My hands don't earn me too much gold
For security when I grow old
But we will all be equal under the grass
And God's got a heaven for

You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye,""

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

I lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in.
You stay a little while and then you're gone again.
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie.
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.

When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you.
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.

Recorded by Johnny Cash on 7/30/68
Number one - County Chart; Number 42 - Pop Chart

I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver linin' behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were
Tryin' to make a livin' out of blackland earth
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud ...

CHORUS
Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne ...

No, the circle won't be broken
Bye and bye, Lord, bye and bye ...
Daddy'll sing bass, Mama'll sing tenor
Me and little brother will join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

Now I remember after work,
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singin' for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while.

CHORUS
Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne ...

No, the circle won't be broken
Bye and bye, Lord, bye and bye ...
Daddy'll sing bass, Mama'll sing tenor
Me and little brother will join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

31867,/johnny-cash/,Dark As The Dungeon,"Come all you young fellers so young and so fine
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mine
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul
'Til the blood of your veins runs as black as the coal

Where it's dark as the dungeon and damp as the dew
Where the dangers are many and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as the dungeon way down in the mines

It's many a man I have seen in my day
Who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope or a drunkard his wine
A man must have lust for the lure of the mine

I hope when I'm gone and the ages do roll
My body will blacken and form into coal
Then I'll look down from the door of my Heavenly home
And pity the miner a-digging my bones

31868,/johnny-cash/,Dear Mrs,"Dear Mrs though we've never met I know very much about you
I know that you've got hair that shines like the morning sun
You've got eyes that hold the blueness of the sky
And of the deepest sea on a clear day and a smile that has a sparkle of a diamond
I know that because I've heard him say those things about you
These're the thoughts and the words of a man
Who spent many heart breaking years behind prison walls
The father of your children the man who worshipped the very ground that you walk on
He had a picture of you Mrs it was old and faded and torn
But you could tell at a glance that he never exaggerated in his thoughts and visions
He never left his cell without first checking to see if he had your picture with him
He was a young man when he first came to prison
And he talked a great deal about you but as the years passed he talked less and less
And during his last year here I don't believe he ever said a word to anybody
He had the appearance of a man much older than he really was
He walked with his head down and his shoulders saggin'
And the walk itself seemed to take a great deal of effort
He never received a letter or had a visitor while he was here in prison
But never did he stop looking and waitin'
Every day at mail call you could see him standing close to his bars
With the look of a child awaiting a reward
Even after the mailman had passed his cell his pleading eyes would follow beggin'
As always he'd feel of his shirt pocket and then just stand there
Staring at the emptiness and as always I could somehow feel the lumb in his throat
And the burning in his eyes you know Mrs like just before you start to cry
Well I thought you might like to know that they buried his body today
Just outside the prison walls
They buried him there because nobody cared enough to claim his body
You know there was even a couple of old convicts there that actually cried
No not because they cared for him but for what he died from they cared for
Loneliness every prisoner knows loneliness but some know it more than others
The man that they buried today had died many times
Every day he waited hopin' and prayin' for a letter or a card
Or just a note or anything to let him know that somewhere out there
Somebody cared for him
That assurance never came and today he died Mrs
He died from loneliness starved for love a love that nobody ever wanted
You see no man woman or child is immune to the need of love or to be loved
No matter how terrible his crime might have been
The death he died from today was more inhuman
But his suffering is over now and he's resting in a pauper's grave in a prison suit
And in his pocket is an old torn and faded picture of yes of you Mrs"

And I met Delia there
Found her in her parlor
And I tied to her chair

She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to
Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round

First time I shot her
I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died

Jailer, I can't sleep
'Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet

You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her

Others before him had done just the same.

Some went to heaven without any name.

Can hurt you somehow.

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy,
She'll beat you if she's able.

Have been laid upon your table.
But you only want the things that you can't get.

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger:
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home.
And freedom, oh freedom,
Well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking,
Through this world all alone.

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're loosin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling,
Goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, and open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you,
You better let somebody love you,
You better let somebody love you,
You better let somebody love you,
Before it's too late.

Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, why has every well I've drilled gone dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
We's like desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter, a driller of oil wells
He's an old school man of the world
He taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives was like, some old Western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they played
I was just a kid, they all called me ""Sidekick""
Just like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
He's got brown tobacco stains all down his chin
Well to me he was a hero of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men
Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Jus' like desperados waitin' for a train
Like a desperado waitin' for a train

The day before he died I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone.
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
(spoken) Come on, Jack, that son-of-a-bitch is comin'

Like desperados waitin' for a train

And I dreamed about those cottonfields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long

I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home

Homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines

Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I was just wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride
And put on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones I left waiting far behind

I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home

(Down in Dyess Arkansas and that part of the delta land where I grew up
I did my earliest singing and I learned my first songs
While picking or chopping cotton out in a cotton patch
Seems somebody was always singing while they worked
To help make the day go a little bit faster
I can remember my sister Louisie out in the cottonfields
She would keep us all cheered up by singing gospel songs and the hits of the days
And being a few years older than I was she'd teach me songs she'd say
I'm going to sing you this song three times
And then see if you're listening you sing it back to me
Sometimes she'd be way down the row picking ahead of me
And while she was waiting for me to catch up I could hear her singing)"

To tempt the fiddle player for
He's just a mortal man
""The sin of pride,"" the devil
Cried is what will do you in
""I thought we had this settled,
I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny did you ever know
That time keeps marching on
The coldest hour is the one
Comes just before the dawn
The devil's back in Georgia
Will you stand up to the test
Or will you let the devil be the best?

""In truth I haven't played much
Since the baby came in June
But give me half a minute an'
I'll get this fiddle back in tune""

The devil grabbed the golden
Fiddle out of Johnny's hand and said
""Though I'm the fiddle player
Underground and I walk upon the land""

""Y'all just better be just turnin'
Back if you want this boy to win
'Cos practice is the only cure for
The predicament he's in""

""Now devil it would be a sin
For you to get my bow
You go on back to hell and to
The wood shed I will go""

Johnny are you practicing or
Will your hands grow cold?
The devil walks the land and
Plays a fiddle made of gold
Can you hear the babe a crying,
Will he ever know
The devil wants his daddy's very soul?

""Before we play I want to
Thank you for letting God's
Own Word ring true
He said you can't be trusted""
""Yes but what you gonna do?""
""Well you get your fiddle devil if
You think that you can win
'Cos I beat you once you old dog
And I can whip your butt again""

Called a peacemaker but I never knew why

Well I get into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw

Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

Now can't you just see yourself walking along leading your pet Trachadon
Or feeding your Brontosaurus Rex or scratching your Diplodocus' neck
Or riding on a Stegosaurus' back or swimming in Brachiscaurus' track
Oh what a time and oh what a fun play and tag with your Ignanondon

His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town. ""

He drank his first strong liquor then
to calm his shaking hands
And tried to tell himself
at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mother's words

Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill

Filled with rage, then, Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun
and fired before he even saw

And wondered at his final words

Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never done before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right"

I have picked wild roses
Far into september
But I had no one to give the flowers to
I needed a celebration
A September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you

[June Carter:]
I've watched the gentle winds change
The colors shades of meadows
Ive seen the dew on flowers that had no name
But I let my vase stay empty
like my lonely empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same

[Chorus:]
Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love
and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think its come out time

[Johnny:] Would you take this small bouquet
that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And a feeling that your love is close at hand
[June:] Thank you for the flowers
now lets walk through the meadows
Through the brook where our demands caress the sand

[Chorus]
Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love
and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think its come out time"

Down where the willow and the dogwood grow

From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell
And there's room for the forsaken if you're there on time
You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes

There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist
And I know that your name can be on that list

And even the soldier who pierced the side of the Lord Is down there by the train
Down there by the train

Down there where the train goes slow

Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer
Never given of myself, never truly cared

I saw fall And even now,
every time I dream I hear the men
and the monkeys in the jungle scream

Drive on, don't mean nothin'
My children love me , but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on

I remember one night,
Tex and me Rappelled in on a hot L.Z.
We had our 16's on rock and roll
But, with all that fire,
was scared and cold
We were crazy, we were wild
And I have seen the tiger smile
I spit in a bamboo viper's face
And I'd be dead , but by God's grace

Drive on, don't mean nothin'
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on

It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain
And nobody tried to be John Wayne
I came home, but Tex did not
And I can't talk about the hit he got
I got a little limp now when
I walk Got a little tremolo when
I talk But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam

Drive on, don't mean nothin'

Ira Hayes

[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died"

Saying my darling son be careful how you run
For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time

Up the road he darted against the rocks he crashed
Upside down the engine turned and georgie's breast was smashed
His head lay against the firebox door the flames were rolling high
I'm glad to be born for an engineer on the c&o road to die

The doctor said to georgie my darling boy lie still
Your life may yet be saved if it is god's blessed will
Oh no said george that will not do I want to die so free
I want to die with the engine I love one hundred and forty three

And as you give the razor a preliminary wave
This fool will walk up and ask you, ""are you gonna take a shave?""

""no! I ain't prepared for shavin', I just like the taste of soap!

To stand upon
For you, for you

My spirit aches
And I can't stop this river flowing
In fear I take
Each labored breath I draw in knowing
That this could be my life
My final hour
But faith and hope and love
Give me the power
For you, for you

Yay though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
for you are with me
you are with me

I'll be your salvation
Though the storm surrounding
There are no conditions
Lay my body down
In the wake abandon
Willing sacrifice
I'll walk through the canyon
Bring the shadows light
For you, for you

I will drink the cup
The poison overflowing
I will lift you up
Watch over where you're going
The first one in
The last one gone
I'll be the rock to stand upon
The first one in
The last one gone
I'll be the rock to stand upon

I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunardee
I miss the river Shannon and the folks at Skibbereen
The moorlands and the midlands with their forty shades of green
But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar and there's forty shades of green
(Green green green forty shades of green)
I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churching surf
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf
To see again the thatching of the straw the women glean
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see the forty shades of green
But most of all I miss a girl..."

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high,
All these things that won't change, come what may.
Well our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on.
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

Think I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall.
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for.
Yet I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more.

[Chorus]

If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good.
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare,
But by then it would be winter, not much for you to do.
And the winds can sure blow cold way up there.

For me to give up now would be the only reasons

My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing

It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind"

Pickin' cotton, rasin' hell, and bailin' hay

With your wiggle and your walkin', and your big city talkin'
Your brand new shiny plymouth rag-top car

Seems like haste makes for waste every time
And I pray to my soul, when you hear those ages roll
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine

Slapped on the shoe polish left and right

He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
Come rushin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath you could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders coming hard... and he heard their mournful cry

Yipie i oh Yipie i ay
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their face is gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked
With sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they 'aint caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever in the range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire as they ride hard hear them cry

The riders leaned on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a riding on our range
Then cow - boy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch this devil herd... a - cross these endless
Skies.

Her smiling eyes and the mountain light I thought myself insane
These hills have seen me runnin' till my horse could hardly stand
Hidin' by day in the mountains movin' with the moon on the land
I'm hoping to find my freedom in a world that wants me dead
The girl from the canyon took and healed my wounds instead
The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I had done
She laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun

An outlaw is a hunted one with aprice upon his head

And so I left the canyon when I was strong enough to ride

If you go when the snowflakes fall,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me if she is wearing

To keep her from the howlin' winds.

I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said

He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Chorus:
Give my love to Rose please won't you mister
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
For it ain't right that she should live alone

Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Chorus:
Give my love to Rose please won't you mister

Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him

31921,/johnny-cash/,God Bless Robert E. Lee,"When Robert E Lee surrended the Confederacy Jefferson Davis was upset about it
He said how dare that man resent an order
Form the president of the Confederate States of America
Then somebody told him that General Lee had made the decision himself
In order to save lives because he felt that the battle comin' up
Would cost about 20 000 lives on both sides
And he said 240 000 dead already is enough
So this song is not about the North or the South but about the bloody brother war
Brother against brother father against son the war that nobody won
And for all those lives that were saved I gotta say Dod bless Robert E Lee
Well the mansion where the General used to live is burning down
Cottonfields are blue with Sherman's troups
I overheard a yankee say yesterday Nashville fell
So I'm on my way to join the fight General Lee might need my help
But look away look away Dixie I don't want them to see
What they're doing to my Dixie God bless Robert E Lee
Sherman's troups burned Atlanta and the flames lit up the sky
And those of us who survived it are watchin' my Dixie die
But today at Appamattox General Lee sat down
And surrended to the yankees and Ulysees S Grant
So look away look away Dixie...
I won't ever stop loving you my Dixie till they put me in the ground
And the last words they probably hear from me are God bless Robert E Lee"

Get along mule no time to fail,

Reverend jones I know will need these bibles,
He's gonna hold a big revival,
When they built his church with hammers and nails.

Hammers and nails built the country,
Hammers and nails made it strong,
Hammers and nails in my wagon,
Come on mule roll along."
31934,/johnny-cash/,Hank And Joe And Me,"In the desert where we searched for gold the days're hot the nights're cold
Hank and Joe and me walked on so bold and brave and free
For days and days we fought the heat I got so thirsty and I got so weak
And when I fell cause I couldn't go I heard Hank say to Joe
He's dyin' (dyin' dyin') for water hear him cryin' (cryin' cryin') for water
Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die I can't stand to hear him cry for water
I don't remember how long I lay but when I awoke it was the break of day
Buzzards circled miles ahead I knew Hank and Joe were dead
My eyes were dimmed but I could see a bed of gold nuggets under me
Now I know that it won't be long till they decorate my bones
Cause I'm dyin' (dyin' dyin') for water can't help cryin' (cryin' cryin') for water
Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die I can't stand to hear him cry for water
He couldn't stand to hear me cry for water"

On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless cause happiness is you

No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me cause happiness is you

No more chasing moonbeams..."
31936,/johnny-cash/,Hard Times,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more.

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more.

There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more.

Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door

31937,/johnny-cash/,Hard Times Comin',"Life was rough on the lone prairie
We didn't have it made
The northern winds brought the cold snow flury
And brought us close to the grave

You carried our child through the warm spring haul
And if all went well you'd be a mother come to fall
We had hard times comin' with twisters on the ground
We had tumbleweeds runnin'
and they would almost knocked you down

We would hide beneath the storm cellar's door
And without you there I couldn't take it anymore
We had hard times comin' but with your loving we made it alright

The river swelled till the flash
Blood raged washing out the plains
The cottonwood stood with strength of age
And like the trees we remained

It takes the true woman who believes in her man
To stand at his side while he's struggling for his land
We had hard times comin' with sand storms all around
We had prairie hay burnin' our house burned right to the ground

Oh the hardships never did seem to in
But when I'd fall down you'd picked me right back up again
We had hard times comin' but with your loving we made it alright
We had hard times comin' but with your loving we made it alright"
31938,/johnny-cash/,Hardin' Wouldn't Run,"I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light
Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night
For he might have to kill or walk around a fight

And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun
He won't say how many tried and died
Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run

He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train
Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up
So long Janie chin up I'll be back again

Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky

Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid

Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign
You won't find him there for business every day at nine
For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time

Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace

You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar
She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there
Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far

Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun
Wes Hardin chug-a-luggin' red eye got him in the back of the head
John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldn't run"

He was locked into a dead-end occupation his future didn't look too bright
He worked eighteen years on the assembly line
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime
And that could be the end of this story of mine but it's just the beginning
Late one night when he was workin' graveyard harley got himself this big idea
All he's have to do is change one little screw a save millions of dollars a year
So he worked and he saved till he could open his own shop
Money started rollin' in like it wasn't gonna stop
So harley bought a mountain built a mansion on top
So the losers could see whom was winnin'
Only in america with nothin' but a dream only in america where every man's king

First harley's daughter janet found a guru she gave him everything she owned
Then harley junior joined some kind of rockband
And walked around all day about half stoned
His wife watched tv all the time cause she got bored
Then one day she found a tv preacher she adored
And she gave all of harley's hard earned money to the lord
Harley started drinkin' wound up in betty ford
To see if he could by a happy ending
Then some kid who worked in harley's factory he got himself this big idea
Figured out how to do it with compures drove harley out of business in a year
Now harley's back working the assembly line
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime
But don't count harley out cause he ain't the quittin' kind
He stares at that computer with one thing on his mind
How to make them things more user-friendly
Only in america...

But he still loved her through it all,
Hoping she'd come back again.

Kept some letters by his bed,
Dated 1962.
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'.

I went to see him just today,
But I didn't see no tears.
All dressed up to go away,
First time I'd seen him smile in years.

He stopped loving her today,
They placed a wreath upon his door,
And soon they'll carry him away,
He stopped loving her today.

You know, she came to see him last time.
And we were all wonderin' if she would.

31948,/johnny-cash/,Hiawatha's Vision,"On the shores of Gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water
Hiawatha old and greyin' listened to the older prophet listened to lagu
And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways
From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies
Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha
I have seen he said a water bigger that the big sea water
Broader than the Gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it
Salty so that none would use it
Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting
And he spoke to all the people
It's true what lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision
I have also seen the water to the East to the land of morning
And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions
Bigger than a grove of pine trees taller than the tallest tree tops
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly
And it carried many people strange and foreign were these people
And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered
Then said Hiawatha I beheld a darker vision
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies
In our woodlands rang their axes in our valleys smoked their cities
Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful
And the man with bearded faces the men with skin so fair
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people
Farther westward westward westward then wild wild and wilder
Grew the West that once was ours"

You always let it pass you by you said I'd never tell you a lie just because I could

Did you really think I was a bad man?
You always said that that should be my middle name
But you don't know the half of it you don't know how that name fits
You don't know my hidden shame

Hidden shame shame shame that I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

Well there's a different kind of prison
And it don't have to look much like a cell
It's already on your mind boy we can see it in your eyes
So here's the bars and walls that dwelt

Well you know I'm never comin' home babe
You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name
Sure it's easy to be strong when you know the charge is wrong
But the days and weeks get long when you've got a hidden shame

From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

I've had a friend when I was just a boy
We were like brothers we would run and hide
And we went walking on a high hillside
And I really don't know how it happened

He turned to me and had this strange look in his eyes
And not a single word was spoken
I must have pushed him but I don't remember why
And all at once he lay there broken
And I walked out without him and I buried it deep inside

Hidden shame shame shame that I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me


They say you always hurt the one you love
And I'm not sayin' if I did or if I didn't
But like my shame that kind of love is always hidden
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head
They never got me for the thing I really did

Hidden shame shame shame that I can't get free

Must it be my secret for eternity?

But I am still alive.

I was a sailor.
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got
killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around... I'll always be around...
And around and around and around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..."

[ guitar ]
My mother used to tell me I should take it slow
The pace is not what matters it's the direction that you go
Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal
You'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold
Cause I call him when I'm troubled...
Like he always is to answer when I call him"
31958,/johnny-cash/,I Came To Believe,"I couldn't manage the problems I laid on myself
And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else
So I finally surrendered it all brought down in despair
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there

[Chorus:]
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone
Then I cried, ""Lord there must be a sure and easier way
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope every day. ""

[Chorus]
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

Yes, I came to believe in a power much higher than I"
31959,/johnny-cash/,I Can't Help It ( If I'm Still In Love With You),"Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you"
31960,/johnny-cash/,I Corinthians 15:55,"Oh death, where is thy sting?
Oh grave, where is thy victory?
Oh life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal just over the rise
When I see my Redeemer beckoning me

Oh roll my ship over the waves of Your sea
Let me find a safe port now and then
Donât let the Dark One in Your sanctuary
Until itâs time to pack it in

Oh roll my ship with the fire of Your breath
And donât lay a broadside on Your ship as yet
Blow Ye warm winds when itâs chilly and wet
And donât come too soon for collecting my debt

(Chorus)
Oh death, where is thy sting?
Oh grave, where is thy victory?
Oh life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal just over the rise
When I see my Redeemer beckoning me

Oh let me sail on with my ships to the East
And keep my eye on the North Star
When the journey is no good for men or for beast
Iâll be safe wherever You are

Just let me sail into Your harbor of lights
And there and forever to cast out my line
Give me my task and let me do it right
And do it with all of my might

(Chorus)"
31961,/johnny-cash/,I Couldn't Keep From Crying,"I saw you walking by his side heard you whisper all those lies
And I couldn't keep from crying
You sang him love songs tenderly that should have been for you and me
And I couldn't keep from crying
I saw his eyes drinking your charms while he held you in his arms
Him with all his wedding ways rules your heart now in my place
I stood and watched him steal a kiss from two lips I know I'll miss
And I couldn't keep from crying
[ steel ]
I saw his eyes drinking your charms..."
31962,/johnny-cash/,I do Believe,"I do believe that I won't make it through the night
If you don't come on back to me and love me now
There ain't no way that I can say that it's all right
I do believe that you're not thinking anyhow

But I believe if you'll remember how it was a little while
If you'll recall that what we had was hard to beat
And I believe that if you'll meet me half way down that second mile
We will trade in all the bitter for the sweet
I do believe that you're not happy without me
I think you feel the way I'm feeling without you
Come on and give in to that feeling one more time
I do believe you won't regret it if you do


But I believe if you'll remember..."
31963,/johnny-cash/,I Don't Hurt Anymore,"It donât hurt anymore
All my teardrops are dried
No more walkinâ the floor
With that burninâ inside
Just to think it could be
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free
I donât hurt anymore

(Chorus)
No use to deny I wanted to die the day you said we were thru
But now that I find youâre out of my mind I canât believe that itâs true
Iâve forgotten somehow that I cared so before
And itâs wonderful now I donât hurt anymore

(Chorus)"
31964,/johnny-cash/,I Don't Know Where I'm Bound,"I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound,
whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
and I don't know where I'm bound.

Can't stand bars, locks, or doors,
mean cops, insanity, and wars;
gotta find a place of peace,
until then, my traveling won't cease,
but I don't know where I'm bound.

There's gotta be a place for me,
under some green growing tree;
clear cool water running by,
an unfettered view of the sky,
but I don't know where I'm bound.

When I die, don't bury me,
cause then I must be free;
cremate my body with a grin,
throw my ashes to the wind,
cause I don't know where I'm bound.

I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound,
whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
and I don't know where I'm bound.

Got myself a little gal,
she has been a downright pal;
that old highway's calling me,
and free I gotta be,
but I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound.

I don't know where I'm bound.

31965,/johnny-cash/,I Drove Her Out of My Mind,"She gave me my walking papers
and ran off with someone new
Cuz he bought her things
my wages couldn't buy
So I turned to ups and downers
and everything in between
Still I can't get her good lovin'
off my mind

Well today I bought a Cadillac
the kind she's always wanted
I called and asked her
if she'd like to ride
She said this is our last date
I said that's alright with me
cause tonight I'm driving her
out of my mind

Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise
right off of Lookout Mountain
Cause she said I never took her out
when she was mine
She'll see all seven states
as we drive to the pearly gates
tonight when I drive her
out of my mind

All the papers will read ""Lovers leap
again off Lookout Mountain""
Cause I wrote a note
that called it suicide
But my epitaph will say
""he killed his pain yesterday
when he finally drove that woman
off his mind""

Well now here she comes to greet me
dressed to kill and so am I
Hope she asks me if this
cadillac will fly
And I know that I'll die laughin'
when I show her that it will
when I drive that woman
right out of my mind

Hell I'll take her on a scenic cruise
right off of Lookout Mountain
Cause she said I never took her out
when she was mine
She'll see all seven states
as we drive to the pearly gates
tonight when I drive her
out of my mind

They'll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash
down here in Chatanooga
last night when he drove her
out of his mind

Yeah that Cadillac dealer's
in for a big surprise too
99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month
Yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous

But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss in each caress and each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me one day you didn't care how you've hurt me
But you can never steal away mem'ries of what used to be
You think she's yours to have and to hold
But someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
That I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You stole her love from me..."

I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her

I think about her almost all the time

The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

Well I gotta get drunk and I sure do dread it

Well I gotta get drunk Lord I can't stay sober
There's a lotta good people in town
Who'd like to hear me holler see me spend my dollars
I wouldn't think of lettin' 'em down
Well there's a lot of doctors that tell me George

God gave me that girl to lean on,

I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten born to lose
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs

I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
And I don't think I've ever said I feel like I could die
I don't ever lay awake
I never think my heart will break
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry

I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I can't put much feeling in saying love is all gone wrong
I don't lose no sleep at night cause things with you are going right
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs

I never call your name out in my sleep
You never make me worry and you never make me weep
I never wonder if you're true I spend a night curled up with you
And I never call your name out in my sleep

I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I can't put much feeling in saying love is all gone wrong
I don't lose no sleep at night cause things with you are going right
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs"
31975,/johnny-cash/,I Heard That Lonesome Whistle,"I was ridin' Number Nine,
Headin' south from Caroline.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
Got in trouble, had to roam,
I left my gal an' left my home.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
Just a kid, actin' smart,
I went and broke my darling's heart,
I guess I was too young to know.
They took me off the Georgia Main,
Locked me to a ball and chain.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

All alone I bear the shame,
I'm a number, not a name.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
All I do is set [sic] an' cry
When the evenin' train goes by.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
An' my hair turns whiter than snow.
I'll never see that gal of mine.
Lord, I'm in Georgia doin' time.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

31976,/johnny-cash/,I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth goodwill to men
I thought how as the day had come the belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song of peace on earth goodwill to men
And in despair I bowed my head there is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song of peace on earth goodwill to men
(Then pealed the bells more loud and deep God is not dead nor doubt he sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men)
Till ringin' singin' on its way the world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chance so blind on earth goodwill to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep God is not dead nor doubt he sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men"
31977,/johnny-cash/,I Hung My Head,"Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed JebbÃ¢â¬â¢s rifle
And sat on a hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim

My brotherÃ¢â¬â¢s rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brotherÃ¢â¬â¢s rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s where they found me
My head and my hands

The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the court house
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in the chair
Explain to the court room
What went through you mind
And weÃ¢â¬â¢ll ask the jury
What verdict they find

I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on a hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain

And heÃ¢â¬â¢d come to fetch me
To see what theyÃ¢â¬â¢d done
And weÃ¢â¬â¢d ride together
To kingdom come
I prayed for godÃ¢â¬â¢s mercy
For soon IÃ¢â¬â¢d be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head

And he'll be good to you
But still and yet I can't forget
The things we used to do

I just thought I'd tell you this
I love you since that first sweet kiss
It's gonna hurt to miss
Your tender kiss

But I hope you get to do the
Things you say you wanna do
But still and yet I can't forget
The happiness we knew

I just thought you'd like to know
How much you've hurt my pride

31980,/johnny-cash/,I Never Picked Cotton,"(Chorus) I never picked cotton But my mother did And my brother did And my sister did And my daddy died young Workin' in the coal mine

When I was just a baby Too little for a cotton sack I played in the dirt While the others worked 'Til they couldn't straighten up their backs I made myself a promise When I was big enough to run That I'd never stay a single day In that Oklahoma sun

(Chorus) Folks said I grew up early And that the farm couldn't hold me then so I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck And I never went back again Then it was fast cars and whiskey Long haired girls and fun I had everything that money could bring And I took it all with a gun

(Chorus) It was Saturday night in Memphis When a redneck grabbed my shirt When he said go back to your cotton sack I left him dying in the dirt They'll take me in the morning To the gallos just outside And in the time I got There ain't a hell of alot That I can look back on with pride

He took my hand, he called my name.

He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me.
He turned and then I saw
the nail-scarred hands
that bled for me.
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there

My life my heart I gave,
my soul was in his care.

When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow.
This was no dream he turned my way.

Again I heard my Saviour say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well you know I have a love,
a love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive,
to leave I won't let go
But can you see this opposition,
comes rising up sometimes
And its deadfull imposition,
comes blacking through my mind

(Chorus:)
And then I see a darkness (4x)
Did you know how much I love you
Cause I'm hoping some day how you
You saved me from this darkness


Well I hope that someday
We'll find peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
And we can stop our whoring
And draw the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
That isn't all I see

Oh no, I see a darkness (4x)
Did you know how much I love you
Cause I'm hoping some how you
You saved me from this darkness"

31984,/johnny-cash/,I Still Miss Someone,"by John R. Cash and R. Cash, Jr.
Recorded 8/13/58


At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
because I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

"
31985,/johnny-cash/,I Tremble For You,"This world that I live in is empty and cold
The loneliness cuts me and tortures my soul
I'm no child of destiny and no fortune's son
I've just chased you so long now I'm too weak to run.

A new day is here but nothing is new
Alone in my room I tremble for you.

I know I'll return to the backstreets again
To find what I need to prove I'm a man
And there I'll treat shame like an old friend from home
That I can lean on till my mis'ry is gone.

A new day is here and nothing is new
I'm a picture of weakness as I tremble for you..."
31986,/johnny-cash/,I Want To Go Home,"We sailed on the ship John B my grandfather and me around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night got into a fight well I feel so homesick I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B sail see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore let me go home
Let me go home why don't you let me go home
Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home
The first mate he got drunk broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone why don't you leave me alone
Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home
Then the cook he caught the fits threw out all of my grits
Then he took and ate up all of my corn
Let me go home why don't you let me go home
Well this is the worst trip since I have been born
So hoist up the John B sail..."
31987,/johnny-cash/,I Was There When It Happened,"There are some people,who say we cannot tell,
Whether we are saved or, whether all is well;
They say we only can hope and, trust that it is so,
But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know.

Chorus
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (yes, He saved my soul),
The very moment He forgave me (yes, He made me whole);
He took away my heavy burden (yes, He took my sin and),
And He gave me peace within (gave me peace within).
Satan can't make me doubt it (he can't make me doubt it),
It's real and I'm gonna shout it (I'm gonna shout it);
'Cause I was there when it happened (oh, my Lord),
and I guess I ought to know (yes, I ought to know).

Now, I don't care who tells me, salvation is not real,
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel;

And baby I will rock and roll with you if I have to

Memphis 1955 on union avenue
Carl and jerry and charlie and roy and billy riley too
A new sun risin' on the way we sing and a world of weirdo's waitin' in the wings

And baby I will rock and roll with you if I have to"

And the high trapeez and the lady on the horse and the train that carries them thru
Stacked up against all the gold in africa, I'd rather have you

I'd rather share a hotdog with you than dinner with the president
Offer me a castle on a mountain top, I'll take you in a tent
I'd rather be alone with you than to have my very own satellite
To talk and sing and say everything to everybody, do whatever I wanna do
And to be number one on who is who, I'd rather have you

I don't crave applause and praise or holidays with my way paid
I don't want to incorporate nor to be top rate nor a head of state
I don't want to play the digery-do nor the sitar or the kazoo
Just the two of us alone will do, I'd rather have you

I'd rather have tickets to the movies with you than the one that wins the lottery
Rather walk on the beach with you than to own all the ships at sea

And nothing they could do or say could make me think it's wrong
If all the love that made you mine could make you still care
I'd be by your side I'd still be there

I'd give the world if I could only have you close to me
I'd pray the Lord to keep you safe wherever you may be

I'd be with you where I belong...
I'd be by your side I'd still be there"

I'll be all smiles tonight, love, I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I'll be all smiles tonight

Oh when the dance commences, oh how I will rejoice
I'll sing the songs he taught me without a faulting voice
When the flattering ones come around me they'll think my heart is light
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I'll be all smile tonight

And when the room he entered with a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him as though he was a charm
And once he smiled upon her as once he'd smiled at me
They knew not what I suffered, they found no change in me

And when the dance is over and all have gone to rest
I'll think of him, dear mother, the one that I love best
He once did love me dearly and ne'er from me would part
He sought not to deceive me, false friends have changed his heart"

When I'm all alone
In the great unknown,
I'll remember you.

I'll remember you
At the end of the trail,
I had so much left to do,
I had so little time to fail.
There's some people that
You don't forget,
Even though you've only seen'm
One time or two.
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade,
I'll remember you.

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?

I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
It was you who came right through,
It was you who understood.
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to.
In the end,
My dear sweet friend,
I'll remember you"

Got an empty feelin' down inside
Still I need to stay alive
And who can tell what waits beyond this road

But she said the babies need new shoes and I'm a worried man

And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

I am bound for the promised land,

Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

No chilling winds or poisonous breath
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
Are felt and feared no more.

I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

When I shall reach that happy place,
I'll be forever blessed,
For I shall see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest."

But I'm free from the chain gang now
Back home I was known and respected then one day I was wrongly suspected
So they put me in chains in a cold freezin' rain but I'm free from the chain gang now

All the years I was known by a number how I kept my mind is a wonder
And the bare prison cell that was one step from hell

Like a bird in a tree I got my liberty and I'm free from the chain gang now"

Knew how to live right, tried to be a light
Gave everybody a helping hand

I'm gonna try to be that way
I'm gonna try to be that way
Do the kind of things a man oughta do
Say the kind of things a man oughta say
I'm gonna try to be that way

He never done anybody wrong
He tried to help everybody 'long
He brought a better land to make a better man
Out of the rich or the poor
Or the weak or the strong

And he preached love and brotherhood
He went around doin' good, doin' good
Everywhere he went
They knew that he was sent
And the people started actin' like they should"

When your dancing shoes have lost their shine
I'm gonna be gone in mine

Feed the kitchen scraps to the front seat cat

Tell 'em I went where the wild goose goes
I wouldn't have me an area code
Don't have a number, don't need a row

When we're movin' on, oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I've set you free
And I'm movin' on

'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
And keep rollin' on

But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow, and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
'Cause I'm movin on

The midnight train is whining low:
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long,
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud,
To hide its face and cry.

Did you ever see a Robin weep,
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost his will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

Instrumental break.

The silence of a falling star,
Lights up a purple sky.
And then as I wonder where you are,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I'm so lonesome I could cry."

Instead of one more broken entertainer
It struck those in his trade
He could have had it made
If he'd only been a little saner
They traveled far to see him
Oh, the humble and the high
They said goodbye as if he were a friend

Now somewhere he is smiling
On those who idolized him
But would they even recognize him
If he came back again?

He was born of modest means
But had outrageous dreams
They never let him rest
Till he fulfilled them
While he rode that train of song
His devils tagged along
The whiskey and the pills
Just couldn't kill him
He didn't mean to be a rebel
Ah, the real ones never do
They're born apart from ordinary men

Now somewhere he is smiling
On those who sanctified him
But would they even recognize him
If he came back again?

It's an old familiar story
But it's a damn shame none-the-less
They don't forgive his kind
Till they lay them down to rest

Oh, if he came back again"

Had a child by me,who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job,til i started into drinking
And i started making music that went with the devil's band

Oh the years flew by like a mighty rush of eagles
My dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind

If i make my peace with Jesus will they take me back again

If i give my soul,will he cleanse these clothes i'm wearin'
If i give my soul,will he put new boots on my feet
If i bow my head and beg God for his forgiveness
Will he breathe new breath inside me and give back my dignity

If i give my soul,will he stop my hands from shaking
If i give my soul,will my son love me again

With chains upon my feet.
You know that ghost is me.
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.

Because the ending's just too hard to take!

Who gets burned in a three way script.
Enter number two:
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me.
But for now, love, let's be real;
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.
I don't know where we went wrong,
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back.

And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me
And he talks with me

And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I'd stay in the garden with Him
'Tho the night around me be falling
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known"

From angels bending near the Earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies
They come
With peaceful wings unfurl
And still
Their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing

O ye
Beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow
Look now
For glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on
By prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years
Shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth
Shall own the prince of peace
Their King
And the whole world
Send back the song
Which now the angels sing"

When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone

The sun again will shine bright and clear.

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
Keep on the sunny side of life.
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way,
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life.

Let us greet with a song of hope each day.
Though the moments be cloudy or fair.
Let us trust in our Saviour always,
To keep us, every one, in His care.

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
Keep on the sunny side of life.
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way,
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life.

If we'll keep on the sunny side of life."
32041,/johnny-cash/,Kentucky Straight,"Up in kentucky they make a whiskey
They call a kentucky straight whiskey
And up in kentucky I married a woman
That I bet she is a better woman
Than that whiskey is whiskey
I call her my kentucky straight

I've rambled round the country side
I've drifted near and far
I've been off to seek my fortune
I've been followin' every star
I've rode the devil's highway
The hell bound interstate
But now I'm back at happy shack
With my kentucky straight

And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're livin'
She's a little bit old fashioned but her lovin's up to date
And I'm happy here with my kentucky straight

I had looked for satisfaction in the arms of quite a few
And I've done everything that I was big enough to do
But everywhere I see her face from maine to golden gate
And I knew that this is where it's at with my kentucky straight

And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're livin'
I love her so she knows that it was worth a while to wait
Cause I'm happy here with my kentucky straight"
32042,/johnny-cash/,King Of The Hill,"If you gonna be king of the hill you can't make it at the cotton mill)

If you gonna be king of the hill you can't make it at the cotton mill
Get put on at the Harlan mine be the last one out at quittin' time
You already workin' when the whistle blew never complain about a job to do
When they say who can you say I will if you ever gonna be king of the hill
(If you gonna be king of the hill you can't make it at the cotton mill)

You need a good woman to share your bed to keep you loved and to keep you fed
To help you to face another day to get you up and on your way
Where the golden rule don't rule out true you do them before they do to you
Watch out for yourself or nobody will if you ever gonna be king of the hill
(If you gonna be king of the hill you can't make it at the cotton mill)

Saturday night you go to Harlan town you shoot some pool and you fool around
You watch the girls and you drink bootleg get starved to death before you beg
You trust in luck till your luck is gone then jump right in and you hang right on
There may be times you would have to kill if you ever gonna be king of the hill
(If you gonna be king of the hill you can't make it at the cotton mill)

When the last of the coals out of every vein
Had long been gone an the northbound train
Woke up to the top and if you're standing still you can call yourself king of the hill
But if you fall like a lot have done by accident or knife or gun
When they lay you high on the mountain still you can call yourself king of the hill
(If you gonna be king of the hill) you can't make it at the cotton mill"

32044,/johnny-cash/,Kneeling Drunkard's Plea,"Lord have mercy on me Was the kneeling drunkard's plea And as he knelt there on the ground I know that God in heaven looked down

I went down by an old country church I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch And as he reached his mother's grave I saw that drunkard kneel and pray

Lord have mercy on me Was the kneeling drunkard's plea And as he knelt there on the ground I know that God in heaven looked down

Bring my darling boy to me Was his mother's dying plea And as he staggered through the gate A lassie came just one day too late

Three years have passed since she went away Her son is sleeping beside her today And I know that in heaven his mother he'll see For God has heard that drunkard's plea

Lord have mercy on me Was the kneeling drunkard's plea And as he knelt there on the ground I know that God in heaven looked down

32045,/johnny-cash/,Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream,"Last night I had the strangest dream Iâd ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war

I dreamed I saw a mighty room filled with women and men
And the paper they were signing said theyâd never fight again

And when the paper was all signed and a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful prayârs were prayed

And the people in the streets below were dancing âround and âround
While swords and guns and uniforms were scattered on the ground

Last night I had the strangest dream Iâd never dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war"
32046,/johnny-cash/,Last Time,"Darling the seasons are changing see now the leaves how they die
Love needs no reason for ending come kiss your baby goodbye
Darling the last time you lied was it really the last time
Have all the tears that you've cried simply dried up and gone
All in the world you can hurt anymore is my feeling
Whatever love ever was never lasted too long
Maybe the best of our life was a beautiful dream babe
That conscience was destined to crumble like castles in sand
All there is left of our love is a little girl's laughter
Let her keep making believing as long as she can
Now and again I still hear some old songs I don't want to
Is it the same over there where you found your new friend
Sometimes at night I still wake up and feel something missing
Maybe I'll never believe in forever again
Darling the seasons are changing see now the leaves how they die
Love needs no reason for ending come kiss your baby goodbye"
32047,/johnny-cash/,Lay Back With My Woman,"Well my saddle's on my horse but I ain't goin' nowhere
Cause my ridin' days are over and there's vultures in the air
Well the trails have been a brother and a devil all in one
I'm gonna lay back with my woman throw away my fightin' guns
Well I spent many lonely evenings listenin' to the howl of the wolfe
Talk about her like a loved one did you ever kiss a horses' hoof
They keep puttin' up all them fences to section up the country mile
I'm gonna lay back with my woman and take it easy for a while

[ banjo ]
Yes there's danger on the prairie there's rattlesnakes that bite
In every little town you come to there's always a good old fight
Well there's nothin' like his and her place I wouldn't say it if I didn't know
I'm gonna lay back with my woman and love her sweet country soul
Well you see her arms are ready and the kitchen's full of food
She's got a smile that's pretty but then it all looks kinda good
Can you blame a guy for thinkin' he'd be crazy to hit the trail
I'm gonna lay back with my woman and put my horses up for sale
I'm gonna lay back with my woman put my horses up for sale"
32048,/johnny-cash/,Lay Me Down In Dixie,"Lay me down in dixie, let the world go by me,
I'm gonna stay right there âtill gabriel calls
Pull your dreams around me, wrap me in your memory,
Lord, I love dixie most of all

Somewhere in the land where the warm sun is shining
Somewhere someone's speaking in the warm southern brogue
Lay me down in dixie, where they understand me,
Lord, I love dixie most of all

Lay me down in dixie, and when they come to take me,
You know that I'll be ready when they call
For I have seen the daylight, so I do not fear the midnight,
Lord, I love dixie most of all

Somewhere in the land where the warm sun is shining
Somewhere someone's speaking in the warm southern brogue

Walk beside me and give me the strenght to go
Fill my face with your courage so defeat won't show
Pick me up when I stumble so the world won't know
Lead me Father with the staff of life give me the strenght for a song
That the words I sing might more strenght bring
To help some poor troubled weary worker along
When my way is light but I still can see
With a strong hand strike out the blindness in me
Show me work that I should carry on for Thee
Make my way straight and narrow like you wanted to be
Lead me Father..."
32050,/johnny-cash/,Lead Me Gently Home,"Oh lead me gently home father lead me gently home
When life's toils are ended and parting days have come
Sin no more will tempt me there from Thee I'll roam
If you'll only lead me father lead me gently home
Oh lead me gently home father lead me gently home
If I fall upon the wayside lead me gently home
Lead me gently home father lead me gently home
If life's darkest hours father when my troubles come
Keep my feet from wandering there from Thee I'll roam
Lest I fall upon the wayside lead me gently home
Oh lead me gently home.."

You better pick on your feet or gonna fall on the floor

you better leave that junk alone and drink water

Lord that liquor is hard drink water
You don't wanna be assault
You better lay down the bottle
And put it on the top and drink

Well your eyes are begging and the bloodshot are ready
It's been a weak or two since you've been in bed
You better pay attention to what I say
You better leave that junk alone and drink water

You better lay down the bottle

Well I forgive for you running around
If you just promess that you come unwild
I buy you anything that you want in town
If you leave that junk alone and drink water

You better lay down the bottle
And put it on the top and drink

32053,/johnny-cash/,Let Him Roll,"Let him roll, boys let him roll
I bet he's gone to dallas rest his soul

Now he was a wino, tried and true
Done about everything there is to do
He worked on freighters, he worked in bars
He worked on farms, 'n he worked on cars

Now it was white port whine, that put that look in his eye
That grown men get when they need to cry
And we sat down on the curb to rest
And his head just fell down on his chest

He said ""every single day it gets
Just a little bit harder to handle and yet...""
Then he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered
The words just rolled off down in the gutter

He was a elevator man in a cheap hotel
In exchange for the rent on a one room cell
And he's years old before his time
No thanks to the world, and the white port wine

And he said ""son"", he always called me son
He said, ""life for you has just begun""
And then he told me the story that I heard before
How he fell in love with a dallas whore

He could cut through the years to the very night
That it all ended, in a whore house fight
And she turned his last proposal down
In favor of being a girl about town

Now it's been seventeen years right in line
And he ain't been straight none of the time
It's too many years of fightin' the weather
And too many nights of not being together

So he died...

Let him roll, boys let him roll
I bet he's gone to dallas rest his soul
Let him roll, boys let him roll
He always thought that heaven
Was just a dallas whore

When they went through his personal affects
In among the stubs from the welfare checks
Was a crumblin' picture of a girl in a door
An address in dallas, and nothin' more

Well the welfare people provided the priest
And a couple from the mission down the street
Sang amasing grace, and nobody cried
'cept some lady in black way off to the side

We all left and she's standing there
The black veil covering her silver hair
And one-eyed john said her name was alice
She used to be a whore in dallas

Let him roll, boys let him roll
I bet he's gone to dallas rest his soul
Let him roll, boys let him roll
He always thought that heaven
Was just a dallas whore
Let him roll, boys let him roll"
32054,/johnny-cash/,Let It Be Me,"Well I've been in love,
But now I'm waiting
Don't ever want to worry 'bout a thing

If you're lonely
Let it me be (Let it me be)

Let it me be (let it me be)
Satisfy you

Well I've seen you around,
but you don't know me.
I've watched your life
But can't always soothe
Well I'll try, and I'll try girl to love you
And when we die-
You will have loved too

Let it me be (Let it me be)
If you're lonely
Let it me be (Let it me be)
Your one and only
Let it me be (let it me be)
Satisfy you
Let it me be, if youre feelin'

Well you know your friends
Talk bad about me
Your folks say it's not supposed to be
Well you know, girl, your life's

Truth is so painful tell me a lie let me down easy and I'll get by

But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore

Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore

32057,/johnny-cash/,Let The Train Blow The Whistle,"I don't want no aggravation
When my train has left the station
If you're there or not,
I may not even know
Have a round and remember
Things we did that weren't so tender
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

On my guitar sell tickets
So someone can finally pick it
And tell the girls down at the Ritz
I said hello
Tell the gossipers and liars
I will see them in the fire
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

Let her blow, let her blow
Long and loud and hard and happy
Let her blow No regrets, all my debts will be paid
When I get laid Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

You'll be left without excuses
For the evils and abuses
Down to today from years and years ago
And have yourself another toke
From my basket full of smoke
And let the train blow the whistle when I go

Let her blow, let her blow
Long and loud and hard and happy
Let her blow No regrets, all my debts will be paid
When I get laid Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

32058,/johnny-cash/,Like A Soldier,"With the twilight colors falling
And the evening laying shadows
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
As I feel my own heart beating out
The simple joy of living
I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling
Was always out there calling
And they said a hundred times I should have died
But now my present miracle
Is that you're here beside me So,
I believe they were roads that I was meant to ride

Like a soldier getting over the war
Like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
Every day is better than before
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

There were nights I don't remember
And there's pain that I've forgotten
Other things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me
In my darkest secret memory
Faces that I wish would not come back at all

In my dreams parade of lovers
From the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey
And that I've survived the battles
And that my spoils of victory are you
"
32059,/johnny-cash/,Like The 309,"It should be a while before I see Dr. Death
So it would sure be nice if I could get my breath
Well I'm not the crying nor the whining kind
'Till I hear the whistle of the 309

Of the 309, of the 309
Put me in my box on the 309

Take me to the depot, put me to bed
Blow an electric fan on my gnarly old head
Everybody take a look, see I'm doing fine
Then load my box on the 309

On the 309, on the 309
Put me in my box on the 309

Hey sweet baby, kiss me hard
Draw my bath water, sweep my yard
Give a drink of my wine to my Jersey cow
I wouldn't give a hootin' hell for my journey now

On the 309, on the 309

I hear the sound of a railroad train
The whistle blows and I'm gone again
It will take me higher than a Georgia pine
Stand back children, it's a 309

It's a 309, it's a 309
Put me in my box on the 309

A chicken in the pot and turkey in the corn
Ain't felt this good since jubilee morn
Talk about luck, well I got mine
As me comin' down like a 309

Write me a letter, sing me a song
Tell me all about it, what I did wrong
Meanwhile I will be doing fine
Then load my box on the 309

On the 309, on the 309
Goin' to get out of here on the 309"

Our finest gifts we bring to lay before the King
This is to honor him when we come
Baby Jesus I am a poor boy too I have no gift to bring that's fit to give a King

Never get rich for to save my soul and forty 'leven years a loadin' coal loadin' coal
Ain't never got acquainted with a dollar bill and I don't ever reckon that I ever will
A dollar ain't made for a fellar I'm told that scoops up a livin' loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal...

I cussed everything in the mining camp from a shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
But I know mighty well till I grow old I'll still be a cussin' but loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal...

I know just as well as coal is black one of these days the mines were strike
And I'll sit around starvin' till I'm finally told
There's a nickel more a ton for loadin' coal

I got a gal in tulsa, that I toot my whistle to

I got 'em all over the land, I'm a locomotive man

Left my heart in omaha omaha, and I never did quite get it back
I got a sue in sioux city, waitin' by the railroad track
(keeps her money in a 'tater sack)
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a locomotive man

Well, I left a little switch engine,
'bout forty miles south of bangor maine
Couldn't keep the wheels a turnin',
shouldn't try to pull my train
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a locomotive man

Well, I had a gal in jackson,

When I checked my time and moved on,
she's hooked on my caboose
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a locomotive man"
32063,/johnny-cash/,Lonesome To The Bone,"On the park bench I slept on raindrops are fallin'
On the newspapers coverin' me
I hear early morning motors
And I know the world is waking for the dawn
But my mind's down in dark alley somewhere
Where last night you loved me
And in the early morning chill
My arms remember still
But I'm droppin' like a stone
Lonesome to the bone

The sun is roughly rising
On the roofs of stagger town
The time for sweatin' poison out
Is just now comin' round
The high time of last midnight
Is over with and gone
Leaving me lonesome to the bone

[guitar]

I walked away the wind blows and any way
The wind goes will be good enough for me
The streets are loud and crowded
But I walk my weary way lost and alone
Your hot breath and your laughter keep flashing
Through my mind to warm me
But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
And I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone

The sun is roughly rising..."

32065,/johnny-cash/,Long Black Veil,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Chorus
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

Repeat Chorus

Well you big mouth woman...

Well I bought you a first class ticket for a luxury liner cruise
I got out in that ocean looked around and there was you

32067,/johnny-cash/,Lorena,"The years creep slowly by, lorena,
The snow is on the grass again;
The sun's low down the sky, lorena,
The frost gleams where the flowers have been.
But my heart beats on as warmly now,
As when the summer days were nigh;
The sun can never dip so low,
Or down affections cloudless sky.

A hundred months have passed, lorena,
Since last I held that hand in mine,
And felt the pulse beat fast, lorena,
Though mine beat faster far than thine.
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may,
When up the hilly slope we climbed,
To watch the dying of the day,
And hear the distant church bells chime.

We loved each other then, lorena,
More than we ever dared to tell;
And what we might have been, lorena,
Had but our lovings prospered well.
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone,
I'll not call up their shadowy forms;
I'll say to them, ""lost years, sleep on!
Sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms.""

The story of that past, lorena,
Alas! I care not to repeat,
The hopes that could not last, lorena,
They lived, but only lived to cheat.
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now;
For ""if we try, we may forget,""
Were words of thine long years ago.

Yes, these were words of thine, lorena,
They burn within my memory yet;
They touched some tender chords, lorena,
Which thrill and tremble with regret.
'twas not thy woman's heart that spoke;
Thy heart was always true to me:
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee.

It matters little now, lorena,
The past is in the eternal past;
Our heads will soon lie low, lorena,
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast.
There is a future! o, thank god!
Of life this is so small a part!
'tis dust to dust beneath the sod;
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart."
32068,/johnny-cash/,Lost On The Desert,"A burnin' hot sun a cryin' for water black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin' somebody's callin' you're lost on the desert to die
I had to give up and they took me to jail but I hid all the money I got
Way out on the desert where no one could get it and I left a mark at the spot
Then I got away and I ran for the desert the devil had taken control
I needed water but he said I'd make it near the money is a big waterhole
A burnin' hot sun...
[ ac.guitar ]
Just up ahead is where I left my mark or it may be to the left or the right
I've been runnin' all day and they'll catch up tomorrow I've got to find it tonight
Then up jumped the devil and ran away laughin' he drank all the waterholes dry
He moved my mark till I'm running in circles and lost on the desert to die
A burnin' hot sun...

32069,/johnny-cash/,Love Has Lost Again,"I guess we're over and it's all been said before
But I still want you though there's no reason anymore
I can't remember when you and I began
It makes no difference cause love has lost again

If there's a reason we forgot it long ago
And if there's an answer it's one I'll never know
The price of giving I just don't understand
but it's collected and love has lost
Again

All that's left now is the closing of the door
It sounds so final but I don't listen anymore
It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again"

I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy
The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me

There was a girl in Denver
Before the summer storm
Oh, her eyes were tender
Oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away the thunder
Kiss away the rain
Even though she's gone away
You won't hear me complain

I have been a rover
I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy
The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me

There was a girl in Portland
Before the winter chill
We used to go a-courtin'
Along October hill
And she could laugh away the dark clouds
Cry away the snow
It seems like only yesterday
As down the road I go

I've been a rover
I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy
The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me"

Will you tell me somethin' Mr Lumberjack is it one for forward and three for back
Is it two for stop or four for go boy ask a whistle punk I don't know
Well I learned this fact from a logger named Ray you don't cut timber on a windy day
Stay out of the woods when the moisture's low
Or you ain't gonna live to collect your doe

Well you work in the woods from morning till night
You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight
On Saturday night you go to Eugene's and on a Sunday morning your pockets are clean
Will you tell me somethin'..."
32072,/johnny-cash/,Mama's Baby,"I met a girl out in a town that tore all my resistance down
I thought what a dream this oughta be
I went with her a month or two and like any boy in love will do
Asked her if she would marry me

But she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
Though she loved me like she never loved another
She was a mama's baby, mama's baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother

Then I said well then probably the only thing that's left for me
Is to go and come back in a year or so
A year passed away and then I tried to win her hand again
She even packed her clothes but she wouldn't go

Cause she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
Though she loved me like she never loved another
She was a mama's baby, mama's baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother

Well I hung around till finally I persuaded her to marry me
Her mother said that it would be all right
We bought ourselves a little home and I finally got her off alone
But she stays with her mother every night

Cause she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
Though she loved me like she never loved another
She was a mama's baby, mama's baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother"

32074,/johnny-cash/,Man In Black,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,
Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.

And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white.

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
And tell the world that everything's Ok,
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black."
32075,/johnny-cash/,Mary Of The Wild Moor,"Was on one cold winter's night
And the wind blew across the wild moor
Poor Mary came wand'ring with a child in her arms
And she stopped at her own father's door.
Oh, father, oh father, she cried
Come down and open the door
Or this child in my arms, will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor.

Oh why did I leave this fair spot
Where once I was happy and free
This wide world to roam, with no friends or no home
And no one to have pity on me.

But the father was deaf to her cry
Not the sound of her voice, did he hear
For the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolled
And the winds blew across the wild moor.

Oh, how the old man must have felt
When he opened the door, the next morn'
And found Mary dead, but the child still alive
Clasped close in it's dead mother's arms.
In anguish, he pulled his gray hair
And the tears, down his cheeks, they did pour
When he saw how that night, they had perished and died

From the winds that blow across the wild moor.
The old man, his life, pined away
And the child, to it's mother, went soon
And no one they say, lives there to this day
And the old house, to ruin, has gone.

But the villagers point out the spot
And the willows droop over the door
Where poor mary died, once a sweet village bride
From the winds that blow across the wild moor.

People getting ready for battle
And there may be just one more
I heard about an earthquake
And the toll it took away
These are the signs of the times we're in today.

CHORUS
Matthew twenty-four is knocking at the door,
And there can't be too much more to come to pass.
Matthew twenty-four is knocking at the door,
And a day or one more could be the last.

A great bear from the northland has risen from his sleep,
And the Army ranks in red are near two hundred million deep.
The young and old now prophesy a coming
Prince of Peace
And last night I dreamed of lightning in the east.

32078,/johnny-cash/,Me and Bobby Mcgee,"Busted flat in baton rouge
Headin for the trains
Feelin nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

Then I took my harpoon
Out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers
Flappin' time and Bobby's hand in mine
We finally sang up every song that driver knew

Freedoms just another word for
Nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord
While Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby Mcgee

From the coalmines of Kentucky
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord
Through everythin I done
And every night she kept me from the cold

And then one day near salinas, lord
I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home, I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine

Freedom's just another word for
Nothin left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy
While bobby sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby Mcgee"

When I give her ten more dollars for a one way ticket She was mad as she could be Then I bet ten more that if she ever left She'd come a-crawlin' back to me When I woke up this mornin' and I turned my head There wasn't a cotton pickin' thing on her side of the bed I found a little old note where her head belonged It said, ""Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone.""

When I heard a whistle blowin', and the big wheels a-turnin' I was scared as I could be I put on my overalls and I headed to town Gonna bring her back with me.

I asked the man down at the station if he'd seen her there I told him all about her pretty eyes and long, blonde hair He spit his tobacco, said, ""I'll be dad blamed...... I believe I did see her leavin' on the east bound train.""

I bought a round trip ticket on the east bound train I was broke as I could be But when I come back, gotta buy another ticket Gotta bring her back with me.

Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas And I worked up the guts to call my Mother-In-Law She said, ""I'll tell you where she is, if you act right."" ""She's workin' four to twelve at Trucker's World tonight.""

When I walked in she saw me, and she took off her apron And she grabbed her goin' home hat She bought a ticket with her tips And now we're curled up on the sofa, me and her....and that mean eyed cat

32080,/johnny-cash/,Meet Me In Heaven,"We saw houses falling from the sky Where the mountains lean down to the sand We saw blackbirds circling 'round an old castle keep And I stood on the cliff and held your hand

We walked troubles brooding wind swept hills And we loved and we laughed the pain away At the end of the journey, when our last song is sung Will you meet me in Heaven someday

(Chorus) Can't be sure of how's it's going to be When we walk into the light across the bar But I'll know you and you'll know me Out there beyond the stars

We've seen the secret things revealed by God And we heard what the angels had to say Should you go first, or if you follow me Will you meet me in Heaven someday

Living in a mansion on the streets of gold At the corner of Grace and Rapture Way In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll Will you meet me in Heaven someday

In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll Will you meet in Heaven someday

Add one stolen night of bliss
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy
Memories are made of this.

Don't forget a small moonbeam
Fold it lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine to sip the wine
Memories are made of this

Then at the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor
Stir carefully through the day
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams that we must savor

With His blessings from above
Serve it generously with love
One man, one wife, one love for life
Memories are made of this

32082,/johnny-cash/,Mercy Seat,"It all began when they took me from my home
And put me on Death Row,
A crime for which I am totally innocent, you know.

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
And all things either good or ungood.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth.
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

My kill hand's tatooed E.V.I.L.
Across it's brother's fist
That filthy five!
They did nothing to challenge or resist.

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold.
It's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away.

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth.
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief.
A life for a life and a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth.
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie."

My eyes are on fire feels like cotton in my mouth
My whole body's achin' but I got to make them big wheels roll
I got to be in florida by tomorrow morning with a full heavy load
I got to get passed atlanta as soon as I can tonight
I got to try to dodge the scales and stay out of smoky's sight
But there's one big thing standin' like a nightmare in my way

Goin' down monteagle mountain on I-24
It's hell for a trucker when the decil's at your door
He'll tempt you and tell you come on let her roll
Cause the mountain wants your rig and trucker I want your soul

When I started down monteagle the brakes just wouldn't hold
I knew I was in trouble and bout to lose control
The runaway ramp was waitin' I saw the warnin' sign
I said lord help me make it have mercy on this soul of mine
Well I ploughed into that runaway ramp and
I could feel that bigh truck groan
My life flashed right before my eyes and for a minute
I thought I was gone
But when the smoke cleared I thanked god that I was still alive
Cause when there's a runaway on monteagle
some truckers don't survive
Goin' down monteagle mountain...
Yeah many a good man had lost his life
On monteagle mountain it's a long steep grade
Many a good hard workin' boy gone

And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering his life second's numbering
It stopped short never to go again when the old man died
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was plumbing for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering..."

32093,/johnny-cash/,New Cut Road,"Coleman Bonner was a fiddle playin' fool
He's a backwoods rounder and a breaker of mules
Coleman Bonner's got a wore out bow
He's been playin' all day down the new cut road
Coleman's little sister said you better act right Coleman
Daddy's gone to Louisville he'll be back tonight
He's gonna get another wagon and a good pair of mules
And we gonna move to Texas we just waitin' on you
Coleman's daddy pulled up in the yard
He said pack up your lives kids it's gettin' too hard
Kentucky's alright but there's too many people
Just the other day I thought I saw a church steeple
Coleman said daddy don't you worry bout me
I'm gonna stay here in Kentucky till the day I d
I'm gonna drink that sourmash and gonna race that mare
And find that woman with the fox red hair
Now you all been movin' west since the day you got married
Well I'm gettin' off the wagon daddy I'm too old to be carried
Gonna stay here in Kentucky where the bluegrass grow
I'm gonna play it all night down the new cut road
Coleman's daddy said now what's it all comn' to
Young people these days are just as stubborn as mules
You can't make him go he's too old for that
It's that damned old fiddle and that bowler hat
Coleman's mama said let the boy stay
He's raised up solid and he can find his own way
But as for me honey I'm with you
I always thought Kentucky was just passin' through
Coleman's little sister then she started into a cryin'
And his daddy shook his head for the very last time
Coleman's mama said somebody's gotta do it
Wouldn't be no Kentucky less you didn't stick to it Coleman
Coleman Booner stood on the porch of that cabin
Watched 'em all go to Texas in a covered wagon
He pulled out his fiddle and he rosined up his bow
And he played a little tune called the new cut road"
32094,/johnny-cash/,New Mexico,"Tâwas in the town of Griffin
The year was Eighty three
It was there an old cow puncher
Stepped up and said to me
âHow do you do young fellow?
And how would you like to go
And spend a pleasant summer
Out in New Mexico?â

âIâll furnish you good wages
Your transportation too
If you will but go with me
One summer season throughâ
âBut if you should get homesick
And back to Griffin go
Then Iâll furnish you no horses
From the hills of Mexicoâ

We left the town of Griffin
In the merry month of May
When all the world was lovely
And everything was gay
With saddles on our horses
Marching over we did go
Until we reached the logging
Out in New Mexico

It was there our pleasures ended
And our troubles they began
The first hail storm fell on us
Those cattle how they ran
Through all the thorns and thistles
Us cowboys had to go
While the Indians watched upon us
Out in New Mexico

Well when the drive was over
The riders would not pay
To all you happy people
This much I have to say
Go back to your friends and loved ones
Tell others not to go
To the god forsaken country
They call New Mexico"

Where meek souls
Will receive him still

sometimes when I turn aside And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead That stretched upward toward the great divide

Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie These words came low and mournfully From the pallid lips of a youth who lay On his dying bed at the close of day

Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there But we took no heed to his dying prayer In a shallow grave just six by three We buried him there on the lone prairie.

How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee?
Shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old apache squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea, fleein' to the sea?

Well, now they tell me that you saw cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, ""the next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man""

Old apache squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
Have you had misty eyes for years?
Could that mist be tears? could that mist be tears?

Well, now they tell me that you saw cochise
When he made his last stand

32111,/johnny-cash/,Old Doc Brown,"He was just an old country doctor in a little country town
Fame and fortune had passed him by though we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way he'd serve us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small
Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he'd receive a fee
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he
He had to sell his furniture couldn't pay his office rent
So to a dusty room over a livery stable Doc Brown and his satchel went
And on the hitchin' post at the kerb below to advertise his wares
He nailed a little sign that read Doc Brown has moved upstairs
And one day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door
Old Doc Brown was layin' down but his soul was no more
They found him there in that old black suit on his face was a smile of content
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had write these words Paid In Full
Old Doc should had a funeral fine enough for a king
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing
Cept Jones an undertaker he did mighty well
Donated an old iron casket he had never been able to sell
And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and the style
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one
Cause he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done
We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed a sign
We'd painted it white and to all of us it certainly did look fine
Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint
There ain't nothin' left but Doc's own sign and that's gettin' pretty faint
But you can still see that old hitchin' post as if in answer to our prayers
Mutually tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairs"

Away from us on the evening train

As I turned to walk away from the depot
It seemed I heard her call my name
Take care of my baby and tell him darling
That I'm going home on the evening train

32115,/johnny-cash/,One Piece At A Time,"Well, I left kentucky back in '49
An' went to detroit
Workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin'
Wheels on cadillacs

Every day I'd watch them
Beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'cause I always wanted me
One that was long and black.

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there
In a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all
By the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth
At least a hundred grand.

Chorus
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me
When I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'cause I'll have the only one there is a round.

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox
And with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box
Full of gears
Now, I never considered myself a thief
Gm wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out
Over several years.

The first day
I got me a fuel pump
And the next day
I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission
And all of the chrome
The little things I could get
In my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts,
And all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck
Out in my buddy's mobile home.

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'til we tried to put it
All together one night
And that's when we noticed
That something was definitely wrong.

The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts
All the holes were gone.

So we drilled it out
So that it would fit
And with a little bit of help
With an a-daptor kit
We had that engine runnin'
Just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left
And one on the right
But when we pulled out
The switch all three of 'em come on.

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together
And when we got thru
Well, that's when we noticed
That we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes
That she had her doubts
But she opened the door
And said ""honey,
Take me for a spin""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin'
For blocks around
But up there at the court house
They didn't laugh
'cause to type it up it
Took the whole staff
And when they got through
The title weighed sixty pounds.

Chorus
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me
When I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'cause I'll have the only one
There is around.

(spoken) ugh! yow, red ryder
This is the cotton mouth
In the psycho-billy cadillac come on

Huh, this is the cotton mouth
And negatory on the cost
Of this mow-chine there red ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ugh!, what model is it?

Well, it's a '49, '50, '51,
'52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58' 59' automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62,

32116,/johnny-cash/,One Too Many Mornings (Feat. Bob Dylan),"Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark.
As the night comes in a-fallin',
The dogs 'll lose their bark.
An' the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind,
For I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.

From the crossroads of my doorstep,
My eyes they start to fade,
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid.
An' I gaze back to the street,
The sidewalk and the sign,
And I'm one too many mornings
An' a thousand miles behind.

It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good,
When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
You can say it just as good.
You're right from your side,
I'm right from mine.
We're both just too many mornings
An' a thousand miles behind."
32117,/johnny-cash/,One Way Rider,"Ow, you're off and runnin'
Run just like you're scared
Run just like a grey dog
Run just like a deer

Something in the bushes
Starin' out at you
Starin' at your feelings
Feelin' like you do

One way rider
One way down the road
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

Lovers save your secrets trust not into fools
Don't go look for trouble it will come to you
Like some long lost passage fly in broken lines
Here in the fleeting moment really gone this time

One way rider
One way down the road
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

[Solo instrumental]

Once upon a victim circumstance is due
Tend to take a hold on everything you do
First we follow leaders
Next we follow fools now we follow
Footsteps sneakin' upon you

One way rider
One way down the road
Baby I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

One way rider
One way down the road
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

Sunday drivers only way to go
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go"

Number 2 - County Chart



I dedicate this song to the workin' man
For ever' man that puts in a hard
Eight or ten hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody lookin' down his neck
Tryin' to get more out of 'im
Than he really ought to have to put in.

After twenty-nine long years of workin'
In this shop with Oney standin' over me ...
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire ...

The superintendent just dropped by and said
They'd planned my little get together ...
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire.

I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the mornin' feelin' tired ...
And old Oney don't remember, when I came here
How he tried to get me fired ...
With his folded hands behind him
Every mornin' Oney waited at the gate ...
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clockin' in five minutes late.

But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen 'em do when any man retires
Then old Oney's gonna tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire ...

He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this ...
But there's one thing he's not countin' on
Today's the day I give old Oney his.

I've been workin', buildin' muscles
Oney's just been standin' 'round a gettin' soft
And today about four-thirty
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost ...
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the workin' man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
'Cause today I show old Oney who's the boss.

Hmmmm! What time is it? Four thirty!
Hey, Oney!
Oney! Ha ha ha ha!

32121,/johnny-cash/,Out Among The Stars,"It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
Closing time another day is done
When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job but Lord he's found a gun

He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
That he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
Already he can feel that great relief

Oh how many travelers get wear-y
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars

He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

Oh how many travelers get wear-y
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars

The evening news carries all the details
He dies in every living room in town
In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries we'll never live this down

Oh how many travelers get wear-y
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars

That over the next hill we'll be home

It's a straight and narrow highway
No detours and no by ways
And over the next hill we'll be home

From the prophets I've been hearin'
I would say the end is nearin'
For I see familiar landmarks all along

By the dreams that I've been dreamin'
There will come a great redeemin'
And over the next hill we'll be home

I would say there's no mistakin'
That over the next hill we'll be home

There's a place that we are nearin'
That so many have been fearin'
And over the next hill we'll be home

When we get there we're all hopin'
That we'll find the gate is open
And there'll be a refuge from the comin' storm

For the way's been long and weary
But at last the end is nearin'
And over the next hill we'll be home"
32123,/johnny-cash/,Pack Up Your Sorrows,"But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use crying, talking to a stranger
Naming the sorrows you've seen
'cause there's too many bad times, too many sad times
And nobody knows what you mean

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use rambling, walking in the shadows
Trailing a wandering star
No one beside you, no one to guide you
And nobody knows where you are

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use roaming, walking by that roadside
Seeking a satisfied mind
There's too many highways, too many byways
And nobody's walking behind

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows

You would lose them, I know how to use them

32124,/johnny-cash/,Paradise,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to western kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn

""and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister peabody's coal train has hauled it away""

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the green river
To the abandoned old prison down by adrie hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

""and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister peabody's coal train has hauled it away""

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

""and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister peabody's coal train has hauled it away""

When I die let my ashes float down the green river
Let my soul roll on up to the rochester dam
I'll be halfway to heaven with paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am

""and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

32125,/johnny-cash/,Paul Revere,"In April of 1775
This great nation started comin' alive
Ol' King George didn't look it one bit
So he proceeded to throw him a royal fit

He told his generals better get 'em back in line
Make 'em pay my taxes now America is mine
Stop that Independence cops before it gets around
Or it'll gonna be hard to hold them rebels down

Well the King was talking bout the men like Paul Revere
And the minute men who held their dream of Independence dear
They kept their eyes on the British they watched 'em day and night
They knew very soon they'd get their chance to stand and fight

Yes they knew that the British would get movin' any hour
So they arranged a signal in the Northern Church Tower
Paul was watchin' when the tower showed a light
And he started on his midnight ride

He jumped on his horse hoofs started a hummin'
He screamed out his warning redcoats're comin'
Better get your guns and your fightin' britches on
They're comin' and they're eight hundred strong

Next mornin' at Concord and Lexington town
The spirit of freedom turned the redcoats around
When we praise the men who made this mighty nation we have here
Then let's remember Paul Revere yes let's remember Paul Revere

I guarantee you somethin' and I wanna tell you all
That we never would've been here if it hadn't been for Paul
Yes sir I surely doubt us ever bein' here
If it hadn't been for that man on that horse named Mr Revere"

(Spoken)
I got cotton in the bottom land
It's up and growin' and I got a good stand
My good wife and them kids of mine
Gonna get new shoes, come Pickin' Time
Get new shoes come Pickin' Time.

Ev'ry night when I go to bed
I thank the Lord that my kids are fed
They live on beans eight days and nine
But I get 'em fat come Pickin' Time
Get 'em fat come come Pickin' Time.

The corn is yellow and the beans are high
The sun is hot in the summer sky
The work is hard til layin' by
Layin' by til Pickin' Time
Layin' by til Pickin' Time.

It's hard to see by the coal-oil light
And I turn it off purty early at night
'Cause a jug of coal-oil costs a dime
But I stay up late come Pickin' Time
Stay up late come Pickin' Time.

My old wagon barely gets me to town
I patched the wheels and I watered 'em down
Keep her in shape so she'll be fine
To haul my cotton come Pickin' Time
Haul my cotton come Pickin' Time.

Last Sunday mornin' when they passed the hat
It was still nearly empty back where I sat
But the preacher smiled and said that's fine
The Lord'll wait til Pickin' Time
The Lord'll wait til Pickin' Time.

The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
to the fields of green
And the homeland
we've never seen.

They killed us in our tepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the firesticks
and the wagons come
And the night falls
on the setting sun.

They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
at the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
and a pipe to share.

I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the mornin'
on the fields of green
In the homeland
we've never seen.

And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk about Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
Like the Astrodome
and the first tepee

Come a lookin' direct towards boudleaux and me

I turned to boudleaux and me I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Lock up the coffee in the coffee pot
Put the flour in your pillow cause it's all we got
Hang the lantern from the ceiling and watch your head
Ho boudleaux put the sugar to bed boudleaux

Well the sky she get dark and then she turn dark black
I yell she gonna blow one right out of the almanac
A big raindrop smacked me right on the ear
And I hollered hey boudleaux but the way the wind blow
He just as soon be deaf there wasn't no how to hear
I try to call to boudleaux but slid instead
Then me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed

Well the ends of that shrimpin' boat was switchin' around
She turned sideways and inners and outers and upside down
The water come in tryin' to drown the both of us
The closet top open and the shillet went a flyin' me
I hit my head and kinda cuss

But most of all I frowned when she calm that I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Ain't nothin' dry but my railroad watch the

We built a fire for the coffee and we chicory fed
Cause me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed

32136,/johnny-cash/,Ragged Old Flag,"By John R. Cash, ÃÂ© 1974 House of Cash, Inc.

I walked through a county courthouse square,
On a park bench an old man was sitting there.
I said, ""Your old courthouse is kinda run down.""
He said, ""Naw, it'll do for our little town.""
I said, ""Your old flagpole has leaned a little bit,
And that's a Ragged Old Flag you got hanging on it.""

He said, ""Have a seat,"" and I sat down.
""Is this the first time you've been to our little town?""
I said, ""I think it is."" He said, ""I don't like to brag,
But we're kinda proud of that Ragged Old Flag.

""You see, we got a little hole in that flag there when
Washington took it across the Delaware.
And it got powder-burned the night Francis Scott Key
Sat watching it writing Say Can You See.
And it got a bad rip in New Orleans
With Packingham and Jackson tuggin' at its seems.

""And it almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag, but she waved on though.
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill.
There was Robert E. Lee, Beauregard, and Bragg,
And the south wind blew hard on that Ragged Old Flag.

""On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha gun.
She turned blood red in World War II.
She hung limp and low by the time it was through.
She was in Korea and Vietnam.
She was sent where she was by her Uncle Sam.

""She waved from our ships upon the briny foam,
And now they've about quit waving her back here at home.
In her own good land here she's been abused --
She's been burned, dishonored, denied, and refused.

""And the government for which she stands
Is scandalized throughout the land.
And she's getting threadbare and wearing thin,
But she's in good shape for the shape she's in.
'Cause she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more.

""So we raise her up every morning, take her
down every night.
We don't let her touch the ground and we fold
her up right.
On second thought, I do like to brag,
'Cause I'm mighty proud of the Ragged Old Flag.""

From the side it came down
From the feet it came down
And ran to the ground
Between heaven and hell
A teardrop fell In the deep crimson dew
The tree of life grew

And the blood gave life
To the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price
That set the captives free
And the numbers that came
Through the fire and the flood Clung to the tree
And were redeemed by the blood

From the tree streamed a light
That started the fight 'Round the tree grew a vine
On whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came
Fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks
Of six-sixty-six

And the blood gave life
To the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price
That set the captives free
And the numbers that came
Through the fire and the flood Clung to the tree
And were redeemed by the blood

From his hands it came down
From his side it came down
From his feet it came down
And ran to the ground
And a small inner voice Said ""You do have a choice.""

32140,/johnny-cash/,Redemption Day,"I've wept for those who suffer long
But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killing
It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
Oh what mercy sadness brings
if God be willing

There is a train
That's heading straight to heaven's gate
To heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man and woman wait
Watch and wait, for redemption day

Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen on television
Come leaders, come you men of great
Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening

What do you have for us today?
Throw us a bone but save the plate
On why we waited til so late
Was there no oil to excavate?
No riches in trade for the fate of
Every person who died in hate?
Throw us a bone, you men of great

There is a train
that's heading straight to heaven's gate
To heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man and woman wait
Watch and wait, for redemption day

It's buried in the countryside
It's exploding in the shells at night
It's everywhere a baby cries
Freedom. Freedom. Freedom
Freedom. Freedom"

Sold I to the merchant ships,
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit.
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty.
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly.

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever have:
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets,
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it:
We've got to fulfill de book.

By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was high
Any man that will fight to the death cross over
But if you want to live you'd better fly
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine
Hey Santa Anna we're killing your soldiers below
That men wherever they go will remember the Alamo
Ol' Bowie lay dying his powder was ready and dry
Flat on his back Bowie killed them a few in reply
And young Davy Crockett was singing and laughing with gallantry fears in his eyes
For God and for freedom a man more than willing to die
Hey Santa Anna...
They sent a young scout from the battlements bloody and loud
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud
Grieve not little darling my dying if Texas is sovereign and free
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be
Hey Santa Anna..."

The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap

There was a time when goin' way out west meant goin' to Kaintuck
The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it
Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner
Came down the wilderness road like countless families did
Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap
It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away
The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone
I guess prob'ly Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood
(If you love your wife and love your baby man
Turn your wagons back as soon as you can
Ev'ry Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck)

And you know when you got certain things on board
When you go through the toll-gate
Well, you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well, a traindriver, he pulled up to the toll-gate
And the man hollered nicely what all he had on board
And he said:
I got live stock, I got live stock
I got cows, I got pigs, I got sheep
I got mules, I got all live stock
Well, they said, you're all right boy
You don't have to pay no toll
You just go right on through
So, he went on through the toll-gate
And as he went through...
He started pickin' up a little bit of speed
Pickin' up a little bit of steam
He got on through and he turned to look back at the man
And he said:
Well, I fooled you, I fooled you
I got pig iron, I got pig iron
I got all pig iron
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a might good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line is a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you gotta ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line
Oh, cloudy in the west and it looks like rain
Around the curve comes a passenger train
Northbound train on a southbound track
He's already leaving, but he won't be back
Well the Rock Island Line, she's a might good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride

Well if you ride it you gotta ride it like you find it

But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

There are two more drinks that he'd like to try
The doctor said, what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

On the out-skirts of town
She took her high heels off
And rolled her stockings down
She put a quarter in the jukebox
To get a little beat
Everybody started watchin'
All the rhythm in her feet

She's my rock'n'roll ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll ruby, rock'n'roll
When ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy it satisfies my soul

Now ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock
And when she started rockin'
She just couldn't stop
She rocked on the tables
And rolled on the floor
And everybody yelled: ""ruby rock some more!""

She's my rock'n'roll ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll ruby, rock'n'roll
When ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy it satisfies my soul

It was 'round about four
I thought she would stop
She looked at me and then
She looked at the clock
She said: ""wait a minute daddy
Now don't get sour
All I want to do
Is rock a little bit more""

She's my rock'n'roll ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll ruby, rock'n'roll
When ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy it satisfies my soul

One night my ruby left me all alone
I tried to contact her on the telephone
I finally found her about twelve o'clock
She said: ""leave me alone daddy
'cause your ruby wants to rock""

Rollin' where the urge tells him to go
And all this cowboy really needs is a tank of gas and entry fees
To get him to the next big rodeo

A cowboy don't need all that motern stuff
A cowboy's gotta be lean and mean he trains
on caffine and nicotine
And them all night drives help to make him tough

He's underfed and under paid and too damn hungry to be afraid
Some where between the crazy and insane
Cowboys ain't afraid pf dyin' shoot he'd even ride a red eyed lion
If you'd show him where to take the rein
Now the only coach a cowboy needs
is a growlin' gut that says come on let's eat
So tonight cowboy you better make a winning ride
Bout the only thing that makes him go
Is that big gold buckle waitin' down the road
And a bad case of too much cowboy pride"

A flower not fading nor falling apart,

You brighten my blackest of skies.

To leave those memories there.

Close my eyes and see.
And fall into the heart and arms,


Of those who wait for me.
I cannot move a mountain now;
I can no longer run.
I cannot be who I was then:
In a way, I never was.

I watch the clouds go sailing;
I watch the clock and sun.

And burn away the clouds.

To a place where I can rest.

Don't waste your time now asking me why
I don't know I know I'll just be moving along
You say that home is where my love is at
I said that home is where I hang my head
The time has come to sing a traveling song

You want a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match you know the cage they wile would be wrong
You think that love is friends a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year alone
The time has come to sing a traveling song

Someday where we sat in your old porch swing
A tamer man may offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on love that never could be
What's right for others just ain't right for me
The time has come to sing a traveling song mhmm mhm"

A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said well a bless my soul

You load sixteen tons what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning it was drizzling rain
Fighting and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebreak by an old mama lion
Ain't no high tone woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

A lot of men didn't a lot of men died
One fist of iron the other of steel

Lately that just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they once did
They pass more quickly like when I was wild

And somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

The mid summer days ain't too heavy
They just flow like a breeze through my mind
And nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for some old lost times

And somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

Somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground"

But the thrills were too high for my little sky so I dug in and I've settled down
And I got a good job in Nashville no way they can pay me enough
For grindin' up tobacco leaves making brut and snuff
Southern comfort is killin' me I'm slowly chokin' in Tennessee
I shovel the snuff until late afternoon
Then I crawl with the traffic and I choke on its fumes
And fall on the face when I get to my room southern comfort is killin' me

I met a woman in Nashville for a while we were carryin' on
She'd washed the snuff out of my shirts every night
And keep me with clean ones on
But I guess she got tired of tobacco at least of the regular kind
Now I'm still workin' where nicotine and memories're burning my mind
And southern comfort is killin' me the Cumberland cannot enhermit each bee

And about this time tomorrow I'll be gone

32178,/johnny-cash/,Starkville City Jail,"by Johnny Cash

Well, I left my motel room, down at the Starkville Motel,
The town had gone to sleep and I was feelin' fairly well.
I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees;

I was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the southern breeze.
I found myself surrounded; one policeman said: ""That's him.
Come along, wild flower child. Don't you know that it's two a.m.""

They're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.

Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town;
I said: ""What the hell did I do?"" He said: ""Shut up and sit down.""

Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks.
I said: ""Wait, my name is..."" ""Awe shut up."" Well, I sure was in a fix.

The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night;
I said: ""Come back here, you so and so; I ain't bein' treated right.""

Well, they're bound to get you, cause they got a curfew,
And you go to the Starkville City Jail.

I started pacin' back and forth, and now and then I'd yell,
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell.
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came.

Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name.
At 8 a.m. they let me out. I said: ""Gimme them things of mine!""
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion.

They're bound to get you, 'cause they got a curfew,
And you go to the Starkville City Jail.

32180,/johnny-cash/,Streets of Laredo,"As I walked out on the streets of Laredo.
As I walked out on Laredo one day,
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped in white linen,
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.

""I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by.
""Come an' sit down beside me an' hear my sad story.
""I'm shot in the breast an' I know I must die.""

""It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing.
""Once in the saddle, I used to go gay.
""First to the card-house and then down to Rose's.
""But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin.
""Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall.
""Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin.
""Roses to deaden the clods as they fall.""

""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly.
""Play the dead march as you carry me along.
""Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me,
""I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother,
""An' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone.
""But please not one word of the man who had killed me.
""Don't mention his name and his name will pass on.""

When thus he had spoken, the hot sun was setting.
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay.
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley,
And there stands his marker, we made, to this day.

We beat the drum slowly and played the Fife lowly,
Played the dead march as we carried him along.
Down in the green valley, laid the sod o'er him.
He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong.

32182,/johnny-cash/,Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin'
chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way.

Chorus:
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down.

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

Repeat Chorus"

Tell all of my friends that I'm coming too coming for to carry me home

A sweet melody for you.
And not some red-hot, upbeat zinger,
That'll set your body on fire.
But a hunk of love included,
Meant to take you a little higher.
And to settle on your sweet, sweet mind,
At night when you retire.

I'm gonna write a tear stained letter.

Proud as we can be, to live in Tennessee

Momma you and Dad gotta come stay with us sometime
I know you'll love that sweet little gal of mine
You and her could take about babies
Make some homemade apple pie

Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around.
And all the girls from there to Austin,
Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: ""Don't stop.""
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on the Tennessee Stud

Had some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Spud And
I rode away on the Tennessee Stud
On a Tennessee Stud
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud

Drifted on down into no man's land
Across the river called the Rio Grande Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe
Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud

The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There was never a horse like the Tennessee Stud

I rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and
I whipped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee Mare

Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There was never a horse like the Tennessee Stud

Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine"
32194,/johnny-cash/,The Ballad Of Ira Hayes,"Ira Hayes,
Ira Hayes

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died"
32195,/johnny-cash/,The Baron,"Wish I had a known ya
When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned
a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little Stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter
Then you doooo
Maybe you'd shoot straighter
Then you do

As he walked into the poolroom
You could tell he didn't fit
In his handmade boots, custom suits
and pearl handled shooting stick
Tonight there'd be a showdown
then everyone would know
Who shoots the meanest game around
The Baron or Billy Joe
Billy Joe looked Edgy
About to lose his cool
But the Baron's hands were steady
As the two began to duel
Yeah he was like a general
on a battlefield of slate
And he'd say to Billy Joe
each time he sunk the eight
He'd Say

Wish I had a known ya
When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned
a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little Stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter
Then you doooo
Maybe you'd shoot straighter
Then you do

Now Billy Joe was busted
But he hadn't felt the sting
And from the far end of the table
He threw his mother's wedding ring
And he said you won my money
But it ain't gonna do the trick
I'll bet this ring on one more game
against your fancy stick
The Baron's eyes got foggy
as the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over
Like he had been hit below the belt
Twenty years ago
It was the ring his wife had worn
And he didn't know before he left
that a son would soon be born
It sounded just like thunder
when the Baron shot the break
But it grew thickly quiet
as He lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder
and it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman
Who had loved him for so long
The game was never finished
The eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up
and put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring
In the hands that held him long ago
and he tossed that fancy shooting stick
To his son Billy Joe
And he said

Wish I had a known ya
When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned
a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little Stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter
Then you doooo
Maybe you'd shoot straighter
Then you do

32196,/johnny-cash/,The Battle Of New Orleans,"In eighteen-fourteen we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississipp'
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
Fought the bloody British in the town of New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'
Wadn't night as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well we looked down the river and we seen the British come
And there must've been a hubdred of 'em beatin' on the drum
Stepped so high and they began to sing
We stood beside the cotton bails and didn't say a thing

We fired our guns...

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well we fired our cannon till the barrel melted down
Then we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind
And when we took the powder off the 'gator lost his mind

We fired our guns...

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
Um pa pa pa um pa pa pa on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Whoopie whoopie get in line there boys

We fired our guns...
Yeah they ran through the briars...
Ha ha you can't catch me can't catch me there redcoat"

And woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
I had to face the who am I and where is she and what did I do
But worst of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
and it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

When the hangover this morning had a personality
And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories
I didn't even touch the light switch so I knew I'd never see
The haggard face that would be staring back at me

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
and it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

Well I had a little feeling to have a big time
And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
I had to face the who am I and who is she and what did I do
But worst of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
and it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did

32199,/johnny-cash/,The Bug That Tried To Crawl Around The World,"Now you've heard of folks with a lot of ambition
But I believe just about the biggest case of ambition I ever saw
Was in a bug that I saw crawlin' along the beach one day
He was a mighty ambitious bug
On the beach one early mornin' as a day was newly dawnin'
And the sun again was warmin' all the chill thru'out the land
I saw me a bug a walkin' and at first I thought he was quakin'
Then I found out he was talkin' while he crawled across the sand
He was crawlin' mighty straight at a slow but a steady gait
And when I asked him to wait he said oh come on crawl with me
But I said where you goin' and he said you'll be knowin'
For I'm gonna make a showin' and you'll someday see
Well I stood there by the ocean I suddenly had the notion
That I start this big promotion so this challenge I enfirled said the bug
So I gave my wife a hug and I left my confy rug
So I could be the only bug that ever crawled around the world
Well he seemed mighty small and it was a long way to crawl
And I'm sure he couldn't swim at all so I try to discourage my friend
I said you know the world is round and there's mighty lotta ground
And there some water to be found before you reach your journey's end
And he said now don't you fret there's problems to be met
But I'll make it you can bet and this deed will bring glory to my name
You know they said man would never fly now he's soarin' in the sky
Cause he had the will to try so let me win my fame
So he crawled on out of sight as he sought that splendoured height
Neither lookin' left nor right but slowly marchin' toward his goal
And my knowin' he had started on his journey as we parted
Kept me from feelin' too down hearted for he was a mighty ambitious soul
Well I've looked everywhere I've been and seen a lotta bugs since then
But not one quite like my little friend when I think of him I'm filled with pride
Did he make it I don't know he was crawlin' mighty slow and he had a long way to go
And all I can tell you folks is that he tried he sure was an ambitious bug"
32200,/johnny-cash/,The Christmas Guest,"It happened one day near December's end
Two neighbors called on an old friend
And they found his shop so meager and lame
Made gay with a thousand bows of green
And Conrad was sittin' with face ashined
When he suddenly stopped as he stiched a twine
And he said ""Oh friends at dawn today
When the cock was crowin' the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And said 'I'm comin' your guest to be.'

So I've been busy with feet astir
And strewin' my shop with branches of fir
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined
Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear His step
As He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and look on His face""
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he'd known
For long since his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas day
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas guest

This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision he'd had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearin' a sound
But all he could see on the snow-covered ground
Was a shabby begger who's shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn
But Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said
""You know, your feet must be frozen and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that'll keep you warmer too""

So with grateful heart, the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait
When he heard a knock he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent ol' lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindlin' piled on her back

She asked for only a place to rest
But that was reserved for Conrad's great guest
But her voice seemed to plead ""Don't send me away
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas day""
So Conrad brewed her a steamin' cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup
But after she left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slippin' away

And the Lord hadn't come as He said He would
And Conrad felt sure he'd misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
""Please help me, and tell me where am I!""
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas day

Again, Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears
Then he led her back to her home once more
But as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not comin' today
For the hours of Christmas had passed away
So he went to his room and he knelt down to pray
And he said ""Dear Lord, why did You delay?
What kept You from comin' to call on me?
For I wanted so much Your Face to see""

When soft in the silence, a voice he heard
""Lift up your head, for I kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
And three times I came to your lonely door
I was the begger with bruised, cold feet
And I was the woman you gave somethin' to eat
I was the child on the homeless street.
Three times I knocked and three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts love is the best
And I was honored to be your Christmas guest"
32201,/johnny-cash/,The Christmas Spirit,"(Praises sing to Christ the King and peace to men on earth)
On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people hail the king
Whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was
In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus
A mass of people movin' here and there I wandered where
On every face at every place was hurry up I'm late
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said merry Christmas mate
And I felt the Christmas spirit
[ choir ]
In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be
And here again was the busy din the rushin' the yellin'
But some kind boy said Frohliche Weihnachten
Not undesratnding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin'
I felt the Christmas spirit
[ piano - choir ]
In Bethlehem I heard a hymn some distant choir sang
And with other tourists I walked along to a church as its bells rang
Then I heard someone tell someone there's where Christ was born
I wonder if he looked like our baby looked on that first morn
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit
From a businessman in the Holy Land as a sidewalk souvenirshop
I bought a little Bible since I'd hardly stopped
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out
And as I flipped the pages I saw these words and I knew what it was all about
For I read fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you he was born this day in the City of David a Saviour
Which is Christ the Lord
[ choir ]
Then I took the little Holy Book held it close and tight
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay
(O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight)"
32202,/johnny-cash/,The Cowboy Who Started The Fight,"The legs on the lady a walkin'
was tanned to a dark berry brown
Her body was made like a song to be played
to the tune of a million a pound

So was a wonder of a woman I reckon
and she sure screwed her head on right
The toast of the world was the long legged girl
and the cowboy who started the fight

He'd just pulled into town in an old green 1953 Chevrolet pickup truck
With whiskey bumps all over it and the right front fender falling off
He coasted on into a no parking zone
Got out and took the keys and chunked 'em down a gutter
Turned around and just walked off

He allowed how his time had been wasted
on drinking and running around
He spent half his life searchin' barrooms at night
For the sweetheart that he never found

It was plain from the moment their eyes met
they'd wind up in each others arms
The lady's young life was laid open that night
And the cowboy drank deep of her charms

Singing hey-hi-de-he from the depths of the sea
to the mountains so hollering high
I've found the best one under God's given sun
yeah the cowboy got lucky tonight

While the angel beside him lay sleeping
he silently thanked God above
For being a kind hearted father
and blessing his love with her love

For one night of love with that woman
was more than he knew he deserved
So he found all he had left worth givin'
and he gave all he had left to her

He slid back inside his ole levi's
and he filled up his boots with his feet
While the subways beneath New York City
screamed through the veins of the street

For the lady gave up without question
the trophy she saved all her life
Then she curled up beside his old weather worn hide
And the cowboy just laid down and died

Hey-hi-de-hi with a whoop through the street
as his soul slowly winged out of sight
The lady was torn from the child bein' born
and the cowboy found heaven that night
The lady was torn from the child bein' born
and the cowboy found heaven that night"
32203,/johnny-cash/,The Danger Zone,"I was laughing at all these people, who
Jump through hoops and loop
In the name of love
I told all my friends this could never
Happen to me
'cause bein' free was all this boy was

Who set my soul on fire
Now I'm a liar
Well I can't control these crazy feelin's
I found my heart is not my own
I'm in the danger zone

Now all of my friends - now they're all

See how long you can go on from man to man
I can read the lines between your stolen glances
And I know it's time to fold this loosing hand
Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
Of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play
You've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
And you've only the devil to pay

You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay

Join your friends while you got 'em
Cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
And I'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way
But when you hit the ground don't come looking around
For the pieces of the love you threw away
That's the price of the high life you're livin'
And you still got the devil to pay

You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone

Gently brushed the silver strand of hair from his wrinkled brow
Lips that used to talk so free the eyes that used to beckon me were silent now
He listens to a passin' train gives into an old familiar pain familiar pain
They retired him twenty years ago gave him a watch made of gold and took his train
His woman's name was Margaret
He loved her but she went away and left his heart undone
He called this train the Diplomat she's the only other lady that he ever loved
Some forty years he made the steam
From Memphis down to New Orleans but now he's off the line
And the closest that he ever gets Margaret or the Diplomat is in his mind
He siad take me to the station the Diplomat is bringing Margaret home
Can't you hear that whistle blowing they both know I've been alone for much too long
Let's not keep 'em waitin' we'll talk about the good times later on
Right now take me to the station the Diplomat is bringing Margaret home

They say he talks crazy when
He sees the passin' train or when he hears Margaret's name
But the only things he ever loved he lost before he loved enough he's not to blame
So who's to say he's right or wrong
Reachin' out and hangin' on to dreams he can't let go
He threw the watch of gold away but keeps tracks of memories where he belongs
He siad take me to the station...
They retired him twenty years ago gave him a watch made of gold
And took daddy's train"

Called him from those he loved,
And seeing that hope was dim.
While
A tear he shed to his wife he said,
""Just have two lanterns trimmed.""

Just hang a light when I pass tonight.
Hang it where it
Can be seen.
If the baby's dead then show the red.
If he's better
Then show the green.

In a little shack,
By the railroad
Track,
A mother with watchful eyes.
Saw a gleam of hope in a tender
Smile,
As the train went rushing by,
Just one short look,
Was
His only chance?
To see the light a gleam.
In the midnight air their
Rose a prayer.
Thank god the light was green.

Just hang a light when I pass tonight.
Hang it where it can be
Seen.
If the baby's dead then show the red.
If he's better then
Show the green."

But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place that long white casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train

The baby's eyes are red from weeping
Its little heart is filled with pain
Oh Daddy cried they're taking Mama
Away from us on the evening train

As I turned to walk away from the depot
It seemed I heard her call my name
Take care of my baby and tell him darling
That I'm going home on the evening train

I pray that God will give me courage
To carry on 'til we meet again
It's hard to know she's gone forever
They're carrying her home on the evening train"

And saw a star
Shining in the East
Beyond them far
And to the Earth

32209,/johnny-cash/,The Flint Arrowhead,"While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creekbed
Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians
There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead
[ ac.guitar ]
Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone
In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night
I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who
Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through
In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust
I'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trust"
32210,/johnny-cash/,The Folk Singer,"As I walk these narrow streets
where a million passing feet have tried before me
With my guitar in my hand suddenly
I realize nobody knows me
Where yesterday the multitude screamed
and cried my name out for a song
The day the streets are empty
and the crowds have all gone home
I pass a million houses but there is no place where I belong
All I knew to give it was song after song after song
All the truth I try to tell you were as distant to you as the moon
Born 200 years too late and 200 years too soon

I'm a child of this age locked inside the pages of your book
And when I am but dust and clay and other children stop take look
Well they marble at the miracles I did before them
And to the heights I did inspired
Or will they tear out the pages of the book to light a fire
With the rain on my face there is no place where I belong
Did you forget the folk singer so soon?
And did you forget my song?"
32211,/johnny-cash/,The Frozen Logger,"As I sat down one evening within a small cafe,
A forty year old waitress to me these words did say

""I see that you are a logger, and not just a common bum,
'cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with is thumb

My lover was a logger, there's none like him today
If you'd pour whiskey on it he could eat a bale of hay

He never shaved his whiskers from off of his horny hide
He'd just drive them in with a hammer and bite them off inside

My lover came to see me upon one freezing day
He held me in his fond embrace which broke three vertebrae

He kissed me when we parted, so hard that he broke my jaw;
I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw

I saw my lover leaving, sauntering through the snow,
Going gaily homeward at forty-eight below

The weather it tried to freeze him, it tried its level best
At a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest

It froze clean through to china, it froze to the stars above
At a thousand degrees below zero, it froze my logger love

They tried in vain to thaw him, and would you believe me, sir
They made him into axeblades, to chop the douglas fir

And so I lost my lover, and to this cafe I come,
And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb"
32212,/johnny-cash/,The Gambler,"About 20 years ago, on a train bound for nowhere,
I met up with The Gambler; We were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' through the window at the darkness.
Til' boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak.

He said: ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
""And knowin' what their cards were, by the way they held their eyes.
""And if you don't mind my sayin', I would say you're out of aces;
""And for one taste of your whiskey, I will give you some advice.""

So I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette; then he bummed a light.
The night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression.
He said: ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right.""

""'Cos ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survival,
""Is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.
""And ev'ry hand's a winner, just like ev'ry hand's a loser.
""And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.

""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.
""You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.

And when he finished speakin', he turned back t'ward the window.
Put out his cigarette; faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

Artist: Johnny Cash lyrics

I'm a charger that charges through the night
Like an orange bolt of lightning passing everything in sight
I'm the best pal the Duke boys ever had
I'm thunder on the highway lookin' bad, bad, bad

I'm a knight, like the kind in shining armor
With my polished body gleaming
I'm a fighter and a charmer
If trouble comes your way just ask for me
My Friends all know me as the General Lee

I'm the Gerneral Lee
A piston pumpin', steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're ridin' with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere
We'll cross the fields and we'll be runnin' free
They'll eat dust compliments of me
The General Lee

I'm a hero, and that's how I'll make you feel
When you're ridin' shotgun with me
And the law is at your heels
I'm glory bound, but when the chase is done
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun

I've got style, tearin through the curves
Let my flag wave proudly to the people that I serve
I'm number one, and I will always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee

I'm the Gerneral Lee
A piston pumpin', steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're ridin' with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere
I'll jump that pond and we'll be runnin' free
And they'll go swimmin', compliments of me

The General Lee, the General Lee

32214,/johnny-cash/,The Gettysburg Adress,"Four score and seven years ago so began the message
Of a war-weary president abraham lincoln
A message written on the back of an envelope on a train
On the way to dedicate a battlefield
Where men from the north and south
had died at gettysburg pennsylvania
Four score and seven years ago our forefathers
brought forth on this continent
A new nation conceived in liberty
And dedicated in the proposition that all men are created equal
Now we're engaged in a great civil war
Testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
And so dedicated can long endure

We are met on a great battlefield of that war
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field
As the final resting place for those who here gave their lives
That that nation might live
It is altogether fitting and proper thast we should do this

But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate
We cannot hallow this ground
For the brave men living and dead who struggled here
Have consecreated it far above our poor power to add or detract
The world will little notice or long remember what we say here

But it can never forget what they did here
It is for us the living rather to be dedicasted here
to the unfinished work
Which they who fought here have thus so nobly advanced
It is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us
That from these honored dead we take increased devotion
To that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion

That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died
In vain and that this nation under god
shall have a new birth of freedom
And the government of the peopole by the people and for the people
Shall not perish from the earth"

Was humbly born
In a stable of wood
And the lowly beasts
Around Him stood

""I"", said the donkey
Shaggy and brown
""I carried
His mother up and down
I carried His mother
To Bethlehem town""
""I"", said the donkey
Shaggy and brown

""I"", said the ox
""This was my hay
I gave Him my manger
'Twas here that He lay
I gave Him my manger
'Twas here that He lay""

""This was my hay""

""I"" said the sheep
With pearly horn
""I gave Him my wool
For a blanket warm
He wore my coat
On Christmas morn""

With pearly horn

""I"", said the dove
From the rafters high
""I sang Him to sleep
That He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep
My love and I""
""I"", said the dove

By some good spell
In the stable dark
Was glad to tell

32216,/johnny-cash/,The Good Earth,"The good earth swallows up the seed and swallows life as well
From long before the day you're born till heaven comes or hell
It binds your hands with chains of clay that are so hard to break
But when I left good earth behind I made a big mistake

I've traveled far and traveled wide
I've seen a lot of things
But looking back on all the years
I don't know what they mean
Like steel I'm probably stronger
From going through the fire
I kept on climbin' lower
Diggin' deeper to get higher

I turned around one evening when the sun was going down
I heard the bible told a preacher who just pulled into town
At last I'm back on good earth where I should have always been
Lord forgive me if I ever try to leave good earth again

Well the good earth was my mama and my daddy too
Now I'm working my hands in soil tryin' to pay my due
And when I'll breathe my last breath which may not be too long
Just shovel a little good earth over my head
Till everybody open up the hymn book and sing a happy song

Shall we gather at the river in the sweet by and by
Just as I am jesus loves me one of these days I'll fly
I'm standing on the promises lord build the place for me
In the good earth over jordan by the sea of galilee mhm"
32217,/johnny-cash/,The Greatest Cowboy Of Them All,"Have always had my heroes I've loved a lot of legends
Many men in my mind are ridin' tall
But my cowboy hero hats off to the man who rode a donkey
He's the greatest cowboy of them all

He loves all his little doggies he speaks to them kind and gently
And he'll lift up any maverick that falls
He sees every stray that scatters like it's the only one that matters
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
Once he rode into the sunset but some returning sunrise

He'll call up all the riders in the sky
I gotta get my roll together gettin' ready for that sunrise
That winds up where old cowboys never die
The trail he rides is narrow but it's straighter than an arrow
And he rides point for all the great and small

He will take us through the wire onto that plain that's higher
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
Once he rode into the sunset...

Ya couldn't get through
Had to do it wrong
Just to get it right

I learned the hard way
The hard way taught me well
The hard way
Sure put me (this boy) through some hell
The hard way
Taught me how to tell
The right way from the wrong
And on which side I belong

Deep are the memories
As a young boy
Of the lessons
That I learned

That fire is no toy
Ya play with fire boy
And you get burned
Oh I got burned

What others learned in sunday school
I learned by gettin' black n' blue"

My daddy sat me down upon his knee he said
""Boy, you go to school and learn your letters
Don't you be a dirty miner like me""

I was born and raised in the mouth of the hazard
Hollow coal cars rambled past my door now
They're standin' in a rusty row all empty
And the l & n don't stop here anymore
I used to think my daddy was a black man

With script enough to buy the company store
Now he goes downtown with empty pockets
And his face is white as a february snow
I was born and raised in the mouth of the
Hazard hollow coal cars rambled past my door
Now they're standin' in a rusty row all empty
And the l & n don't stop here anymore

Last night I dreamed I went down
To the coal yard to draw my pay like
I always did before but them ol' kudzu vines
Were comin' through the window and the leaves

And grass were growin' through the floor
I was born and raised in the mouth
Of the hazard hollow coal cars rambled
Past my door now they're standin' in a rusty row
All empty and the l & n don't stop here anymore"
32220,/johnny-cash/,The Last Cowboy Song,"All)
This the last cowboy song:
The end of a hundred year waltz.
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along.
Another piece of America's lost.

(Waylon Jennings)
He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets,
On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer.
And his dreams of tomorrow, surrounded by fences,
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here.

(Kris Kristoferson)
He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark,
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down.
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas.
And rode with the 7th when Custer went down.

(All)
This the last cowboy song:
The end of a hundred year waltz.
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along.
Another piece of America's lost.

(Willie Nelson)
Remmington showed us how he looked on canvas,
And Louis Lamour has told us his tale.
Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him,
And wish to God we could have ridden his trail.

(Johnny Cash Verse Spoken Over Chorus:)
The old Chisolm trail is covered in concrete now,
They truck it to market in fifty foot rigs.
They roll by his markings and don't even notice,
Like living and dying was all he ever did.

(All)
This the last cowboy song:
The end of a hundred year waltz.
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along.
Another piece of America's lost.

(All)
This the last cowboy song:
The end of a hundred year waltz.
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along.
Another piece of America's lost."
32221,/johnny-cash/,The Letter Edged In Black,"I was standing by my window yesterday morning
Without a thought of worry or regret
When I saw the postman coming down the pathway
He was bringin' me a letter edged in black

Well, He rang the bell and he whistled while he waited
And then he said ""good morning to you Jack""
But he never knew the sorrow that he brought me
When he handed me that letter edged in black

With trembling hand I took the letter from him
I broke the seal and this is what it said:
""Come home, my boy, your dear old father want you
Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead""

""The last words that your mother's ever uttered
Was, 'Tell my boy I want him to come back'
My eyes are doomed my poor old heart is breaking
And I'm writing you this letter edged in black""

I belt my reading sorrow and in silence
The sunshine of my life, it all has fled
Since the postman brought that letter yesterday morning
Saying: ""come home, my boy, your poor mother's dead""

""Thosing andry words I wish I'd never spoken
You know I never mean them don't you Jack
May the angels bear me witness I am asking
Your forgiveness in this letter edged in black"""
32222,/johnny-cash/,The Long Black Veil,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

32223,/johnny-cash/,The Losing Kind,"Lost my job, I lost my money
I turn my back and lost my honey
Lord I guess I'm just the losing kind

Lost my license 'cause I drove too fast
Got in a game and I lost my cash
Lord I guess I'm just the losing kind

Some day the cops are gonna come around
And turn me over to the lost and found
I was sitting on the porch the other day
And watched the finance man drive my car away

I'm too proud to crawl too weak to run
I'd shoot myself but I lost my gun
Lord I guess I'm just the losing kind

(long version includes this verse)
Well if it was a-raining dollar bills
And I was up on the highest hill
Clouds would break out and the sun would shine

The only way that I can win
Is pick a fight and bet on him
Lord I guess I'm just the losing kind

Some day the cops are gonna come around
And turn me over to the lost and found
I just got a letter from a baby of mine
She's in las vegas and she likes it fine

(long version only)
I'm too proud to crawl and I'm too weak to run
I'd shoot myself but I lost my gun
Lord I guess I'm just the losing kind

I bet on the horses to recoup my losses
And lost the tickets on the winning horses
Lord I guess I'm just the losing kind"
32224,/johnny-cash/,The Lovin' Gift,"You gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
You gave me a song I learned to sing
You showed me some beauty
Through the windows of your soul
And you showed me a world I've never seen

Each giving to the other love an' givin' it away
We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
'Cause you gave me the courage
To live with yesterday
And you gave me tomorrow

You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
You taught me a gentle way of dreaming

And even if you leave me
I'll be richer when you go
I'm richer with the lovin' gift you gave me
'Cause you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
And you gave me a baby"
32225,/johnny-cash/,The Man Comes Around,"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder:
One of the four beasts saying: ""Come and see.""
And I saw.
And behold, a white horse.

There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the Man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the Man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Till Armageddon no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the thrown
And at His feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the Man comes around

Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the Man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundred weight and penny pound
When the Man comes around.

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts,
And I looked and behold: a pale horse.
And his name, that sat on him, was Death.
And Hell followed with him."
32226,/johnny-cash/,The Man Who Couldn't Cry,"There once was a man who just couldn't cry
He hadn't cried for years and for years
Napalmed babies and the movie love story
For instance could not produce tears
As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point his tear ducts ran dry
He grew to be a man, the feces hit the fan
Things got bad, but he couldn't cry

His dog was run over, his wife up and left him
And after that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in the war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but sill not a sniffle or sob

His novel was refused, his movie was panned
And his big Broadway show was a flop

He got sent off to jail; you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or drop

In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
But not once did a tear stain his face

Doctors were called in, scientists, too
Theologians were last and practically least

They all agreed sure enough; this was sure no cream puff
But in fact an insensitive beast

He was removed from jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He played lots of chess and made lots of friends
And he wept every time it would rain

Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried

On the forty-first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died

Well, he went up to heaven, located his dog
Not only that, but he rejoined his arm
Down below, all the critics, they loot it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm

His ex-wife died of stretch marks, his ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out

Right down to the ground, that old jail house burned down
The earth suffered perpetual drought
"
32227,/johnny-cash/,The Mercy Seat,"It began when they come took me from my home
And put me on Death Row,
a crime for which I am totally innocent, you know.

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood.

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

My kill-hand's
tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold.
It's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away.

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied.


And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief.
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.

And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie.

A coke an burger cost you thirty cents
I was still in love with Mavis Brown
On the night Hank Williams came to town.

""I Love Lucy"" debuted on TV
That was one big event we didn't see
'Cause no one stayed at home for miles around
It was the night Hank Williams came to town.

Mama ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
We hit that county line for one quick round
On the night HANK WILLIAMS came to town.

A thousand people sweltered in the gym
Then I heard someone whisper; ""Hey, that's him""
That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
It was the night Hank Williams came to town.

On and on he sang into the night
'Jambalaya', 'Cheatin' heart', 'I saw the light'
How'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown
On the night Hank Williams came to town.

Mavis had her picture made with Hank outside his car
She said; ""He sure is humble for a Grand Ole Opry Star.""
Mavis said: ""Why don't we hang around
It ain't often that Hank Williams comes to town.""

While Hank signed his autograph on Beaulah Rice's fan
Mavis got acquainted with the Driftin' Cowboys Band
The effect on all our lives was quite proound
On the night Hank Williams came to town.

Radio announcer's voice in the background:

Remember, friends and neighbors, Hank Williams and all the Drifting
Cowboys will be at the high school gym in person for one show only
this Saturday night. The big 2 hour show starts at 7:30 - tickets are

The night they drove old dixie down, and the bells were ringing,
The night they drove old dixie down, and the people were singin. they went
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,

Back with my wife in tennessee, when one day she called to me,
Virgil, quick, come see, there goes robert e. lee!
Now I dont mind choppin wood, and I dont care if the moneys no good.
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest,
But they should never have taken the very best. (chorus)
Like my father before me, I will work the land,
Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand.

A pickin' singin' folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land

Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered to hear The folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear, said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions keep them to yourself

Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted

You went roamin' in the wildwood like a ship that roams the see
The willow tree is fickle and it weeps in the morning dew
My love is a pine tree cause that's the only tree that's true

If I was mistaken then take my eyes away
You made a bed in the wildwood and that's where I saw you lay
Honey your eyes deceived you it's true I touched the ground
But I never slept there I never let my long hair down mhm

Love is like a thorn bush touch it and you will find
You'll prick your fingers and leave the sweetest flower behind
Love oh love oh what you done to me
You set me a driftin' like a ship upon the sea

Yes a ship there is I see you and you belong to me
My love is the ocean and deeper love cannot be
Yeah well I guess I was mistaken and woman I want you back
You never have left my heart now honey baby that's a fact

And if there is a heaven show us to its gates
Oh you'd better tell us preacher before it's too late
And then the preacher said of heaven, ""Jesus said""

""Jesus said, 'seek ye first the kingdom of God
And his righteousness
And all these things shall be added unto you'""
Well please tell us how we can find a way
To climb every mountain that we face every day
And in time of trouble what to depend upon
To be the truth and help us carry on
And the preacher said of trouble, ""Jesus said""

""Jesus said, 'let not your heart be troubled
If you believe in God believe also in me
In my father's house are many mansions
If it were not so I would have told you
I go to prepare a place for you
And if I prepare a place for you I will come again
And receive you unto myself
That where I am there you may be also'"""

He roamed through the west
Did Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone

He got fightin' mad
This rebel lad
He packed no star
As he wandered far
Where the only law
Was a hook and a draw
The rebel, Johnny Yuma

[Repeat 1st verse]

He searched the land
This restless lad
He was panther quick
And leather tough
If he figured that
He'd been pushed enough
The rebel, Johnny Yuma

Fightin' mad
This rebel lad
With a dream he'd hold
'Til his dyin' breath
He'd search his soul
And gamble with death

32235,/johnny-cash/,The Reverend Mr. Black,"WRITER BILLY EDD WHEELER, JED PETERS

(Spoken) He rode easy in the saddle. He was tall and lean, and at first you'd a-thought nothing but a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong, but one look in his eyes and you knowed you was wrong. He was a mountain of a man, and I want you to know. He could preach hot hell or freezin' snow. He carried a Bible in a canvas sack and folks just called him The Reverend Mr. Black. He was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king. Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing:

Chorus:
I gotta walk that lonesome valley. I got to walk it by myself. Oh nobody else can walk it for me. I got to walk it by myself.
You got to walk that lonesome valley. You got to walk it by yourself. Oh nobody else can walk it for you. You got to walk it by yourself.

If ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back, I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray. Yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor! Then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face! He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinkin' it took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack, but that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black. He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again, and then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said:

(Chorus)

It's been many years since we had to part and I guess I learned his ways by heart. I can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing. I followed him, yes, sir, and I don't regret it and I hope I will always be a credit to his memory 'cause I want you to understand. The Reverend Mr. Black was my old man!

(Chorus)

32236,/johnny-cash/,"The Shifting, Whispering Sands Part II","(listen to the age old story of the shifting whispering sands)

Yes they always whisper to me of the days of long ago
When the settlers and the miner fought the crafty navajo
How the cattle roamed the valley happy people worked the land
Now everything is covered by the shifting whispering sands

(A miner left his buckboard went to work his claim that day)
And the burrows broke their halters
When they thought he'd gone to stay
How they found that ancient miner lying dead upon the sands
And for months they could but wonder
Did he die by human hands

So they dug his grave and laid him on his back
And crossed his hands
And his secret still is covered by the shifting whispering sands
(and his secret still is hidden by the shifting whispering sands)

This is what they always whisper to me out
On the quiet desert air
Of the people and the cattle and that miner lying there
So if you want to learn the secret wander through this quiet land
And I'm sure you'll hear the story of the shifting whispering sands
(and I'm sure you'll hear the story of the shifting whispering sands)"
32237,/johnny-cash/,The Sound Of Laughter,"I stood in there in the shadows
As they went strolling by
Now she ain't my girl no longer
There's no reason I should cry

But I knew there went my future
And I couldn't stop the tears
And the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

I spent every dime I had on her
And when it was gone
She said hun, it's sure been fun
But its time you moved along

So I stood there in the shadows
And I had my .44
I could hear her mocking laughter
But she won't laugh anymore

Now I'm down here in the gaolhouse
And I know what brought me here
It was the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

Well I guess I should have left this town
And her far behind
For the way that she made fun of me
Keeps running through my mind

Well the jury showed no mercy
And I never asked for none
Cause I know I've got it coming
I'm not proud of what I've done

But down here in this darkness
More and more I seem to hear
The sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

I hear the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ear"
32238,/johnny-cash/,The Vietnam Talking Blues,"One morning at breakfast I said to my wife
We've been everywhere once and some places twice
As I had another helping of country ham
she said ""We haven't never been to Vietnam
there's a bunch of our boys over there""
So we went
To the area Saigon
Well we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a placed named Long Ben
We checked in and everything got kinda quite
But a soldier boy said ""Just wait till tonight
Things get noisy things start happening
Big bad firecrackers""

Well that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were living it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
Then we crawled into bed for some peace and quite
But things weren't peaceful things weren't quite
Things were scary

Well for a few minutes June hadn't said a word
Then I thought at first she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say
""What was that"" I said ""That was a shell or a bomb""
She said ""I'm scared"" I said ""Me too""

Well all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs and the motor shells
shook our bed every time one fell and it never let up
It was gonna get worse before it got any better

Well, when the sun came up the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep and we were sleeping sound
Then the soldier knocked on our door and said
""The Last night we brought in seven dead and fourteen wounded!""
And we were come down to the base hospital
And see the boys Yeah

So we went to the hospital war by day
And every night we were singing away
Then the shells and the bombs till dawn again
And the helicopter brought in a wounded man
night after night day after day
coming and a going

So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said so long
We did our best to let them know that we cared
for every last one of them over there
Whether we belonged over there or not
somebody over here loves them and needs them

Well now that's about all there is to tell
about our little trip and the living hell
and if I ever go back over there anymore
I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
I hope this old war's over with and they're all back home
To stay in peace"
32239,/johnny-cash/,The Wall,"There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of em' all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Starin' at the wall...
Starin' at the wall...

In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
namin' her wedding day ,namin' her wedding day...

As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first...
I'm gonna be the first...

Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Cause there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall...
If you ever touch that wall...

Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall...
He never made that wall...

Well there's never been a man who shook this can
But I knew a man who tried
Newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide...

32240,/johnny-cash/,The Wanderer,"I went out walking through streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn and the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye.

Yeah, I went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.
I went wandering.

I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in.
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit.
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it.

I went out riding down that old eight-lane
I passed a thousand signs looking for my own name.
I went with nothing but the thought you'd be there too,
Looking for you.

I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel as much
As a man can before he repents.

I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand.
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one.

Now Jesus, don't you wait up, Jesus I'll be home soon.
Yeah, I went out for the papers, told her I'd be back by noon.
Yeah, I left with nothing but the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you.

Yeah, I went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.
I went wandering."

To her boy one summer day
""if your mind's made up that way, I wish you well
The old home will be lonesome
We'll miss you when you go
The birds won't sing so sweet when you're not nigh
But if you get in trouble, jim
Just write and let us know""
She spoke these words and then she said goodbye

If sickness overtakes you
Or old companions shake you
As through this world you wander all alone
When friends you haven't any

In your pocket not a penny
There's a mother always awaiting you at home

Ten years later to this village
Came a stranger no one knew
His steps were halt and ragged clothes he wore
The little children laughed at him
As down the lane he trod
At last he stopped before a cottage door
He gently knocked, no sound he heard
He thought, ""can she be dead?""
But then he heard a voice well known to him
Was his mother's voice, but her hair had silvered
By the touch of time
And she said, ""thank god, they've sent me home my jim"""

But you might get bored and impatient waiting like those two good brothers over there
They pass around the bottle in the car before they got on the train
Just want to take one more for the road and then, that leads to something else
Well they ainât on the train no more and maybe 9 or 10 got off with them
Thereâs a sister in the church and she says to her friend your husband works at night and so does mine, why donât we just
get together sometime when theyâre gone and go downtown and find us some action, well then they gotta get off the Bible train.
And then another man heâs sitting over there looking at a woman in the corner and heâs gives her that eye, you know and they
meet later, secretly, so they got to get off, this trainâs got a rule against adultery.
And while all this is happening the train is getting ready to go, but thereâs a lot more to get off than different reasons
just before the train pulls out, but listen its starting to move now, listen to it.

And who is going to suffer from the power in your hand

By courage and by fighting, he has not been known to fall
But neither has the fury of the mighty thunderball

To stay.

-Solo- (Ah, pick it Boy - whoo - hoo, whoo - hoo)

Well, I got no trouble and I'm feeling no pain
Got all that good music, blowing in my veins
Let the Light Crust Dough Boys, and Ol' Pappy Dan
Play us a song that we'll never forget

Now they say, times are rough and that money is time
But I don't care on a Saturday night
I got no money, but I can sing blues
When I feel like dancing, way down in my shoes

'Twas in the town of Tulsa, 'bout thirty years ago
At King's Ol' Calloway, down in Old Oklahom'
Where the dust was blowing but the music was right
And Doug Lee O'Daniels played all night"

She climbs a flowery mountains o'er the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball

Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball"

I reached for the gal who was singin' the tune

With a caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a kodiak rug
The song she kept singin' made a man's blood run cold

Sip and each sup will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground

And the whirlwind is in the thorn trees
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn trees
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
Till Armageddon no shalam no shalom

Then the father hen will call his chicken's home
The wise man will bow down before the thorn and at his feet
They will cast the golden crowns

Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still

32286,/johnny-cash/,Wildwood Flower,"Oh I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the rose so red and the lilies so fair
And the mirltes so bright with the emerald dew
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

I will dance I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart in her crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idols were clay
All portions of love had all blown away

Oh she taught me to leve her and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
She left me no warning no words of farewell

Yes she taught me to love her and call me her flower
That was blooming to cheer her through life's dreary hour
Oh I long to see her and regret the dark hour
She's gone and neglected her pale wildwood flower"
32287,/johnny-cash/,Wings In The Morning,"My grandfather lived by the book all his life
On rich-bottomed land with twelve kids and a wife
He never saw tv nor rode a jet plane
But he knew that heaven was holding his claim

Wings in the morning and license to fly
Straight to the portals of nevermore die
Nevermore pain in them old aching bones
Wings in the morning to carry us home

The salt of the earth yet with faith in the lord
They all got together in that one accord
And what could be greater than god's guarantee
That man could have heaven for eternity?

Rocks in the road and we stumble and fall
Light's getting low so we can't see at all
But I promise you on that gettin' up day
Wings in the morning and we'll fly away"
32288,/johnny-cash/,Without Love,"Without love I am half human without love I'm all machine
Without love there's nothing doin' I will die without love
Without love I am an island all by myself in a heartbreak sea
Without love there's no denyin' I am dyin' without love
For there is nowhere I can run and there is no hiding place
Sticking out like a sore thumb by that gloomy look upon my face
Without love I'm incomplete without love I am not whole
Without love I'm barely on my feet I am dyin' without love
[ guitar ]
For there is nowhere I can run...
I am dyin' without love"
32289,/johnny-cash/,Would You Lay With Me,"(In A Field Of Stone)

Verse 1:
Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with me
Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry

Chorus:
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dieing hand
If i gave my self to you

Verse 2:
Would you bathe me with me in the stream of life
When the moon is full would you bathe with me

Will you still love me when i'm down and out
In my time of trials will you stand by me

Chorus:
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dieing hand
If i gave my self to you

Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with me

32290,/johnny-cash/,Wreck of the Old '97,"Well they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,
Said: ""Steve, you're way behind time,
""This is not 38, this is Ol' 97,
""Put her into Spencer on time.""

Then he turned around and said to his black, greasy fireman,
""Shovel on a little more coal.
""And when we cross that White Oak mountain,
""Watch Ol' '97 roll.""

And then a telegram come from Washington station,
This is how it read:
""Oh that brave engineer that run ol 97,
""Is lyin in old Danville dead.""

'Cos he was going down a grade making 90 miles an hour,
The whistle broke into a scream.
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle,
Scalded to death by the steam.

One more time!

Oh, now all you ladies you'd better take a warning,
From this time on and learn.
Never speak hard words to your true-lovin' husband.
He may leave you and never return.
Poor Boy.

32291,/johnny-cash/,Wrinkled Crinkled Wadded Dollar Bill,"I've got a lot of blues on my mind
and at least a million miles behind me
and all that I've got between me
and pauper's hill
is a wrinkled, crincked, wadded dollar bill.

Lake Michigan wind sure is cold
and I need me a jacket for my shoulders
I could buy one down at the surplus store
cheap cotton twill
with my wrinckled crinckled wadded dollar bill

But I'm not bound
and I never will
be to a wrinkled crinckled wadded dollar bill.

It sure smells good at the bakery
and I stand and let the smell flood over me
they sell them day old cakes mighty cheeply
I could eat my fill
with my wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill

But I'm not bound
and I never will
be to a wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill.

Lake Michigan waves hit the beach
and I stand and let them wash at my feet
and then I throw it just as far as I can
into the chill
my wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill.

For I'm not bound
and I never will
be to a wrinkled crinkled wadded dollar bill.

No I'm not bound
and I never will
be to a wrinkled crinkled wadded dollar bill.

32292,/johnny-cash/,You Beat All I Ever Saw,"I've walked though every town
Saw fortunes lost and found
And when your trail failed I walked holes
In both my soles
But I don't expect you back
You're somewhere making tracks
I crossed the burning bridges
And walked through miles of sand
Met the lawless and the law
But you beat all I ever saw

I dreamed a million miles
About your eyes and smiles
I tried to love the best
And to turn from all the rest
But I'd scan the skies for you
And I only saw your hue
They drew away your mould
You were made of frozen gold
And your heart would never thaw
You beat all I ever saw"
32293,/johnny-cash/,You Dreamer You,"I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat,
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you

I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said, ""sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you

I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said, ""sir, I can't marry you,
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you""

Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers,
Home will be a silver tower
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife
With an angel for a wife
You dreamer you
You dreamer you"
32294,/johnny-cash/,You Remembered Me,"You were young and needed love and I was wild and free
But every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
Why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
There were times when I forgot but you remembered me
(there were times when I forgot but you remembered me)

You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
You remembered only to count the days till spring
You knew only love and honor but I couldn't see
I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me
(I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me)

I believed that promises were made to break apart
But every time I broke a vow I always broke your heart
So here's to you god bless you now wherever you may be
There were times that I forgot but you remembered me
(there were times that I forgot but you remembered me)

You remembered only that wedding bells would ring..."
32295,/johnny-cash/,You Wild Colorado,"Oh you wild raging river like my woman's lips you lure me
Pied piper of the desert roll on to the sea
You're the same at noon or midnight and I follow where you go
But you're planning no returning you wild Colorado

If I had no love of life I'd become part of your flow
But I fear the place you'd take me you wild Colorado

Oh you wild raging river from the fountains of the mountains
You ripple down the valleys growing wide and swift and deep
With what powed you cut your canyons how long ago
You're as wayward as my woman you wild Colorado

If I had no love of life..."
32296,/johnny-cash/,You Win Again,"The news is out all over town
that you've been seen out runnin' round
I know that I should leave
but then I just can't go you win again

This heart of mine could never see
what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
what can I do you win again

I'm sorry for your victim now c
ause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain
and someday say you win again

You have no heart you have no shame
you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain
I love you still you win again"
32297,/johnny-cash/,You Won't Have Far To Go,"I can see now that you've stacked the cards so I leave you with my best regards
When you play to feel with nothing left to show look for me you won't have far to go
Love's a gamble and I'm a gamblin' man I've done everything to make you understand
But the odds are high and luck is running low look for me you won't have far to go
You won't have far to go if you want me cause I'm gonna stick close to you
And I'm not the kind to say I told you so look for me you won't have far to go

You won't have far to go..."
32298,/johnny-cash/,You'll Be All Right,"Well I see you've lost your honey bee
I know how you must be feeling now
You feel sad sad but boy it ain't that bad
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
and then you'll be all right

[ piano ]

Well you know it wasn't long ago
your honey bee was queen of my bee tree
But then away she flew and took my honey to you
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit and then you'll be all right

[ piano ]

I pity you I know what you're going through
You watched your queen bee fly your honeycomb went dry
But if you keep pushin' on you won't care if she's gone
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit and then you'll be all right
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit and then you'll be all right"
32299,/johnny-cash/,You'll Never Walk Alone,"When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark.

When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark.
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind,
Walk on through the rain,
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart,
And you'll never walk alone,
You'll never walk alone."

32301,/johnny-cash/,You're My Baby,"I love that hair, long an' black
Hangin' down in the middle of your back
Don't you cut it off whatever you do
Cause I need it to run my fingers through
'cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar

Don't mean maybe, you're my baby
Hey I got a guitar, got six strings
And a guitar pick that make 'em ring
Every string's got a note or two
That I'm gonna use to serenade you

'cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar
Oh you drive me crazy, you're my baby
Well I got a dollar that I saved
I saved it up for rainy day
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
But they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you

'cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my aby
Well I had me a gal, she said she's mine
But she run around on me all the time
Now she's gone an' I'm glad we're through

'cause I-I'm plum-guggled-eyed over you
'cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar
You drive me crazy
Don't mean maybe,
Drive me crazy, you're my baby"
32302,/johnny-cash/,You're The Nearest Thing To Heaven,"I have sailed the peaceful waters
Of the ocean deep and blue
I held my breath and watched
The western sunset's golden hue

I've flown above the mountain peaks
And valley's wide and green
But you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through
The day that I found you
'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are

I confess that I've been tempted
By a luring magic charm
When a smile was flashed my way
And stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because
I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven, darling you

You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through
The day that I found you
'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are

I have watched the silver raindrops
Fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight
When the clouds had blown away
I loved the pretty flowers
But he cannot buy their worth
But you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth

You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
I have searched for happiness for long and far
But my search for love was through
The day that I found you
'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are"
